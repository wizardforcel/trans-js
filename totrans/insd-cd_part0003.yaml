  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Memory management is a critical aspect of programming in C, as it provides control
    over the allocation and deallocation of memory resources. C allows for both static
    and dynamic memory management, giving developers flexibility but also requiring
    responsibility in managing memory efficiently. In this section, we’ll explore
    memory management in C and its various aspects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '1\. Static Memory Allocation:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In C, you can allocate memory for variables and arrays at compile-time, which
    is known as static memory allocation. Memory for these variables is allocated
    on the stack or in the data segment of the program.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: int age;  // Static memory allocation for an integer
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '2\. Dynamic Memory Allocation:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dynamic memory allocation in C is achieved using functions like  malloc,  calloc,
    and  realloc from the  <stdlib.h> library. This allows you to allocate memory
    at runtime and is particularly useful for creating data structures like arrays
    and linked lists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '3\. Memory Deallocation:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you allocate memory dynamically, it’s essential to release that memory
    when it’s no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. The  free function is used
    to deallocate memory previously allocated with  malloc,  calloc, or  realloc.
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '4\. Pointers and Memory Access:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    memory directly. However, improper use of pointers can lead to memory-related
    issues like segmentation faults and memory leaks.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '5\. Stack vs. Heap:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In C, memory can be allocated on the stack or the heap. Stack memory is automatically
    managed and is used for function call frames and local variables. Heap memory
    is explicitly managed and is suitable for dynamically allocated data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '6\. Memory Safety:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: C does not provide built-in memory safety features like bounds checking, which
    means developers must be cautious to avoid buffer overflows and other memory-related
    errors.

    program.
