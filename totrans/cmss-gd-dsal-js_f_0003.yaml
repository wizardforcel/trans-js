- en: This book is the best I’ve encountered on data structures and algorithms. It
    comprehensively explains key concepts in a manner that is both accessible and
    detailed, ideal for beginners as well as experienced programmers looking to enhance
    their skills. All these aspects make A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and
    Algorithms an essential reference in this domain. I highly recommend it!

- en: Jay Wengrow places the reader in the driver’s seat from page one with real-world
    examples and explanations that actually make sense. This updated version takes
    an already great approach to data structures and algorithms and tailors it to
    developers interested in expanding their developer’s tool belt without having
    to learn yet another programming language. It’s got all the right stuff without
    any of the fluff.
