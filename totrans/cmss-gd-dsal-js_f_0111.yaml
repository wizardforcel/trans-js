    solutions to these exercises are found in the section [​*Chapter 11*​](f_0216.xhtml#learning.to.write.in.recursive.solutions)。

    the total number of characters across all the strings。For example, if the input
    array is ["ab", "c", "def", "ghij"]，the output should be 10 since there are ten
    characters in total。

    a new array containing just the even numbers。

- en: A particular numerical sequence is known as triangular numbers。The pattern begins
    as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, and continues onward。To calculate the next number in the
    sequence, we add the previous number from the sequence plus `N`，where `N` corresponds
    to the place in the sequence where the number lies。For example, the seventh number
    in the sequence is 28, since it’s the seventh number in the pattern, so we add
    the number 7 plus 21 (the previous number in the sequence)。Write a `function`
    that accepts a number for `N` and returns the correct number from the series；that
    is, if the `function` was passed the number 7, the `function` would return 28。

- en: Use recursion to write a `function` that accepts a string and returns the first
    index that contains the character “`x`”。For example, the string, "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    has an “`x`” at index 23。To keep things simple, assume the string definitely has
    at least one “`x`”。

- en: This problem is known as the unique paths problem。Let’s say you have a grid
    of rows and columns。Write a `function` that accepts a number of rows and a number
    of columns and calculates the number of possible “shortest” paths from the upper-leftmost
    square to the lower-rightmost square。

    want to get from the `S` (Start) to the `F` (Finish)。
