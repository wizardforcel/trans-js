- en: You will see that RegexPal automatically highlights the portion of the text
    that matches your regex. The program also indicates any syntax errors in your
    pattern. A nice feature of RegexPal is the ability to provide information as you
    type without the need to click on a button to see the result, making it very convenient
    to use.
