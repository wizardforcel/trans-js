    key skill in choosing the best algorithm for your needs, as well as taking existing
    algorithms and optimizing them further to make them significantly faster. Remember,
    while it’s good to be prepared for the worst case, average cases are what happen
    most of the time.

    apply our knowledge to practical algorithms. In the next chapter, we’re going
    to take a look at various everyday algorithms that may appear in real codebases
    and identify the time complexity of each one in terms of Big O.
