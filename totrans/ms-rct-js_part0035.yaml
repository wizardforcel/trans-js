- en: In the world of web development, the backend is the backbone of web applications,
    responsible for processing requests, handling data, and serving responses to the
    client-side. Node.js, a powerful and popular runtime environment built on Chrome's
    V8 JavaScript engine, has revolutionized backend development by allowing developers
    to use JavaScript on the server-side. In this chapter, we will explore Node.js,
    its key concepts, and how to build robust and scalable backend applications using
    this versatile platform.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that
    allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. It was created
    by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and has since become widely adopted in the web development
    community. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient
    and suitable for building scalable network applications.

- en: a. Event Loop
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node.js is built on an event-driven architecture, where events trigger callbacks
    that are registered to handle them. The event loop is a central part of Node.js
    that continuously checks for events and executes the associated callbacks.

- en: b. Asynchronous Programming
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node.js promotes asynchronous programming, where I/O operations and other time-consuming
    tasks do not block the execution of other code. This allows Node.js to handle
    multiple requests concurrently, making it highly efficient for handling a large
    number of connections.

- en: c. npm (Node Package Manager)
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: npm is the package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to install, manage,
    and share reusable JavaScript code packages. It is the largest ecosystem of open-source
    libraries in the world and a crucial tool for Node.js developers.

- en: d. CommonJS Modules
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node.js uses the CommonJS module system for organizing code into reusable modules.
    Modules allow developers to encapsulate functionality and export it for use in
    other parts of the application.

- en: e. Non-blocking I/O
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node.js uses a non-blocking I/O model, which means that I/O operations such
    as reading from a file or making a network request do not block the execution
    of other code. Instead, Node.js continues to process other tasks while waiting
    for the I/O operation to complete.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the fundamental tasks of a backend application is to handle HTTP requests
    and serve responses. Let's create a simple HTTP server using Node.js and Express.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the above example, we import the Express module, create an instance of the
    Express application, and define a route that responds with "Hello, World!" when
    the root URL is accessed. We then start the server and listen on port 3000.

    the console and then calls the `next` function to pass control to the next middleware
    or route handler.
