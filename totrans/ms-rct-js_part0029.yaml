- en: In Chapter 7, we explored DOM manipulation and events, which allowed us to create
    dynamic and interactive web applications. Now, we will delve into asynchronous
    JavaScript and promises. Asynchronous programming is a crucial aspect of modern
    web development, enabling us to handle time-consuming tasks, such as fetching
    data from servers or performing animations, without blocking the main thread.
    Promises, introduced in ES6, provide a more structured and elegant way to manage
    asynchronous operations. Understanding asynchronous JavaScript and promises is
    essential for building efficient and responsive web applications. Let's dive in
    and explore the world of asynchronous JavaScript and promises!

    Asynchronous programming allows us to perform tasks without waiting for the result,
    making our applications more responsive.
