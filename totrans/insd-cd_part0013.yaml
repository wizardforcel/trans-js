- en: Memory management is a critical aspect of programming languages, as it directly
    impacts the allocation and deallocation of memory during program execution. One
    fundamental concept in memory management is the distinction between stack and
    heap allocation.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stack memory is a region of memory that follows a last-in, first-out (LIFO)
    allocation scheme. It is typically used for storing local variables, function
    call information, and managing function execution. Stack allocation is fast and
    deterministic because memory is allocated and deallocated in a known order.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In languages like C and C++, when you declare a local variable inside a function,
    it is usually allocated on the stack.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stack memory is limited in size, and its scope is typically limited to the duration
    of a function call. When a function exits, the memory allocated on the stack for
    its local variables is automatically deallocated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Heap Allocation
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Heap memory, on the other hand, is a region of memory used for dynamic memory
    allocation. It is not bound by the same LIFO constraints as the stack and is suitable
    for managing data structures of varying sizes and lifetimes. Heap memory is managed
    explicitly by the programmer, and it is essential to allocate and deallocate memory
    correctly to avoid memory leaks or access violations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and deallocating memory on the heap.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    scope of a single function or block, making it suitable for data structures like
    linked lists, trees, and objects with complex lifetimes.

    memory that is no longer in use, relieving programmers from the responsibility
