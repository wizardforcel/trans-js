    at a particular index inside the array.

- en: A computer can read from an array in just one step. This is because the computer
    has the ability to immediately access any particular index in the array and peer
    inside. In our example of ["apples", "bananas", "cucumbers", "dates", "elderberries"],
    if we looked up index 2, the computer would jump right to index 2 and report that
    it contains the value "cucumbers".

    cell’s address. Here’s a visual that shows each cell’s memory address:'

- en: A computer can access any memory address in one step. For example, if you asked
    a computer to inspect whatever’s at memory address 1063, it can immediately access
    that without having to perform any search process. As an analogy, if I ask you
    to raise your right pinky finger, you wouldn’t have to search all your fingers
    to find which one is your right pinky. You’d be able to identify it immediately.

- en: Whenever a computer allocates an array, it also makes note at which memory address
    the array begins. So if we asked the computer to find the first element of the
    array, it would be able to instantly access the appropriate memory address to
    find it.

- en: Now, these facts explain how the computer can find the first value of an array
    in a single step. However, a computer can also find the value at any index by
    performing simple addition. If we asked the computer to find the value at index
    3, the computer would simply take the memory address at index 0 and add 3\. (Memory
    addresses are sequential, after all.)

- en: Reading from an array is, therefore, an efficient operation, since the computer
    can read any index by jumping to any memory address in one step. Although I described
    the computer’s thought process by breaking it down into three parts, we are currently
    focusing on the main step of the computer jumping to a memory address. (In later
    chapters, we’ll explore how to know which steps are the ones worth focusing on.)

    Besides being a foundational data structure, arrays are also a very powerful data
    structure because we can read from them with such speed.

    3, we flipped the question around and asked at what index "dates" can be found?
    That’s the search operation, and we’ll explore that next.
