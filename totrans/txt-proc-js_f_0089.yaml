- en: There are several ways to implement regular expressions in JavaScript. In this
    book, weâ€™ve mostly worked with test(), match(), and replace(). But JavaSript also
    provides methods such as exec(), search(), matchAll(), replaceAll(), and split()
    that you should be aware of.

    of the String object. Knowing the difference between these tools and when to use
    each enables you to write programs that are more compact and more efficient.
