- en: Data is a broad term that refers to all types of information, down to the most
    basic numbers and strings. In the simple but classic “Hello World!” program, the
    string ’Hello World!’ is a piece of data. In fact, even the most complex pieces
    of data usually break down into a bunch of numbers and strings.

    same data can be organized in a variety of ways.

- en: This simple program deals with three pieces of data, outputting three strings
    to make one coherent message. If we were to describe how the data is organized
    in this program, we’d say that we have three independent strings, each contained
    within a single variable.

- en: You’re going to learn in this book that the organization of data doesn’t just
    matter for organization’s sake, but can significantly impact how fast your code
    runs. Depending on how you choose to organize your data, your program may run
    faster or slower by orders of magnitude. And if you’re building a program that
    needs to deal with lots of data, or a web app used by thousands of people simultaneously,
    the data structures you select may affect whether your software runs at all or
    simply conks out because it can’t handle the load.

    the software you’re creating, you’ll have the keys to write fast and elegant code,
    and your expertise as a software engineer will be greatly enhanced.

    arrays and sets. While the two data structures may seem almost identical, you’re
    going to learn the tools to analyze the performance implications of each choice.'
