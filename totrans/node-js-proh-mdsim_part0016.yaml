    by implementing input validation and error handling. By validating user input
    and handling errors effectively, we can prevent common security vulnerabilities
    and provide a better user experience. Let's dive in and enhance the security of
    our application!

    the integrity of data. By validating user input, we can protect our application
    from common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)
    attacks.

    Then, we define validation rules using the `body()` function for each parameter.
    For example, we use `notEmpty()` to ensure that the `username` field is not empty,
    `isEmail()` to validate the `email` field as an email address, and `isLength()`
    to specify the minimum length for the `password` field.

    If there are any errors, we return a 400 status code with an array of error messages.

    and comment creation to ensure that the data received is valid and secure.
