  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows
    developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. Unlike traditional
    web development frameworks, Node.js utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O
    model, which makes it incredibly efficient and suitable for handling concurrent
    requests.

- en: One of the significant advantages of Node.js is its use of JavaScript as the
    primary programming language. JavaScript is a widely adopted language, which means
    developers can write both the client-side and server-side code in the same language,
    simplifying the development process and promoting code reuse.

- en: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, developed by Google, which compiles
    JavaScript code directly into machine code. This compilation process results in
    highly performant applications that can handle a large number of concurrent connections
    without consuming excessive system resources.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node.js employs an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that it
    can efficiently handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution
    of other operations. This architecture makes Node.js particularly suitable for
    building real-time applications, such as chat servers or streaming platforms.

- en: Node.js has a vibrant and extensive ecosystem of packages and libraries, known
    as the Node Package Manager (NPM). NPM provides access to a plethora of pre-built
    modules that developers can easily integrate into their projects, saving time
    and effort.

    allows you to experiment with JavaScript code and execute it in real-time. To
    launch the Node.js REPL, open your command prompt or terminal and type the following
    command:'
