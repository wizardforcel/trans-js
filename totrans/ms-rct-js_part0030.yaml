- en: In Chapter 8, we explored asynchronous JavaScript and promises, which are essential
    for building efficient and responsive web applications. However, as developers,
    we often encounter errors and bugs in our code. Error handling and debugging are
    crucial skills that help us identify and fix issues in our programs. Understanding
    how to handle errors and effectively debug code is vital for producing reliable
    and robust applications. Let's dive in and explore the world of error handling
    and debugging in JavaScript!

    runtime errors, or logical errors in our code.

    or unexpected results due to flawed logic.

    of a square instead of a rectangle, resulting in a logical error.

  prefs:

    and prevent the code from stopping abruptly.

    If an error occurs, it is caught in the `catch` block, and the specified error
    handling code is executed.

    provide more specific information about the problem.

    is zero and throws a custom error if it is. The custom error is then caught and
    handled in the `catch` block.

    print values and messages to the console.

    the final result to the console for debugging.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Modern browsers provide powerful developer tools that allow us to set breakpoints
    in our code. A breakpoint stops the code execution at a specific line, allowing
    us to inspect variables and the program's state.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the above example, we set a breakpoint in the `calculateArea()` function.
    When the code is executed, it will pause at that line, and we can inspect the
    values of `width`, `height`, and `area`.

    Chrome browser. It provides various debugging features, including a console, sources
    panel for code debugging, and network panel for inspecting network activity.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    when the browser's developer tools are open.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE

    it will pause if the browser's developer tools are open.

- en: In this chapter, we explored error handling and debugging in JavaScript, essential
    skills for identifying and fixing issues in our code. We learned about different
    types of errors, such as syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors. The
    `try...catch` statement allows us to handle errors gracefully, preventing the
    code from crashing. We also saw how to throw custom errors to provide specific
    information about problems in our code.

    for printing values and messages, setting breakpoints in the code, and using browser
    developer tools like Chrome DevTools. These tools enable us to inspect variables
    and the program's state, making the debugging process more efficient and effective.

    applications. As you continue your journey in JavaScript, practice these techniques
    to become a proficient debugger and create high-quality code.
