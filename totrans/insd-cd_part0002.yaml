  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    own unique features and use cases, some languages share common characteristics
    and principles. In this section, we’ll explore the common features found in five
    widely used programming languages: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '1\. Compiled vs. Interpreted: C and C++ are compiled languages, meaning the
    source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution. This
    results in faster and more efficient programs but requires separate compilation
    for different platforms. In contrast, Java, JavaScript, and Python are interpreted
    languages. They are executed by an interpreter at runtime, allowing for greater
    portability but potentially sacrificing some performance.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '2\. Syntax and Control Structures: All five languages use C-style syntax, characterized
    by curly braces {} to denote code blocks and semicolons ; to terminate statements.
    They support common control structures like conditionals (if-else statements)
    and loops (for, while) for program flow control.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '3\. Strong Typing: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python are all statically
    typed languages, meaning variable types are explicitly declared and checked at
    compile time. This helps catch type-related errors early in the development process,
    ensuring safer and more reliable code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and use functions or methods. Functions in C and C++ are standalone, while Java,
    JavaScript, and Python support both standalone functions and methods within classes
    or objects.'
  prefs: []

    libraries that provide pre-built functions and classes for common tasks. These
    libraries simplify development by offering a wealth of functionality, from file
    handling to networking.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '6\. Memory Management: C and C++ provide manual memory management, giving developers
    control over memory allocation and deallocation. Java, JavaScript, and Python,
    on the other hand, feature automatic memory management through garbage collection,
    simplifying memory-related tasks.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '7\. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++, Java, and Python are object-oriented
    languages, promoting the use of classes and objects for modular and organized
    code. JavaScript, while not strictly OOP, supports object-based programming with
    its use of prototypes and object literals.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '8\. Portability: Java is known for its “Write Once, Run Anywhere” portability
    due to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JavaScript, being primarily used for web
    scripting, is highly portable across different browsers. Python is celebrated
    for its cross-platform compatibility, and C and C++ can be compiled for various
