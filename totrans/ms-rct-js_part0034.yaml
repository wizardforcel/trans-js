    user interfaces. Now, let''s delve into another popular frontend framework: Angular.
    Developed and maintained by Google, Angular is a comprehensive framework that
    simplifies the process of building dynamic and scalable web applications. Angular
    follows a component-based architecture and provides a rich set of features for
    managing data, handling routing, and interacting with APIs. In this chapter, we
    will explore Angular, its key concepts, and how to build robust and feature-rich
    web applications using this frontend framework.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Angular is an open-source frontend framework for building single-page applications
    (SPAs) and dynamic web applications. It provides a complete solution for frontend
    development, including data binding, component-based architecture, dependency
    injection, and much more. Angular is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript,
    which adds static typing and other features to enhance the development experience.

- en: a. Modules
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Angular, modules are used to organize the application into logical blocks.
    A module is a container for related components, services, and other application
    features. Each Angular application has at least one root module, which is the
    entry point of the application.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the above example, we define an Angular module with its metadata, including
    the components, directives, modules, services, and the root component to bootstrap
    the application.

- en: b. Components
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Components are the building blocks of Angular applications. Each component is
    responsible for a specific section of the user interface and its associated behavior.
    Components can be reused throughout the application and communicate with other
    components using inputs and outputs.

    which displays a greeting message.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Templates define the UI of an Angular component. They use Angular's template
    syntax, which is similar to HTML, to render dynamic content and data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE2]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the above example, we use a template in the `GreetingComponent` to display
    the greeting message with the dynamic `name` property.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Data binding in Angular allows us to synchronize data between the component
    and the template. There are four types of data binding:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Interpolation: Binding data from the component to the template using double
    curly braces `{{ }}`.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Services in Angular are used to share data and logic across multiple components.
    They provide a way to centralize functionality and separate concerns in the application.

- en: f. Dependency Injection
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Angular's dependency injection system allows us to inject services or other
    dependencies into components. This promotes loose coupling and makes components
    more modular and reusable.

    the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface).
