    write code once and run it on multiple platforms without modification. In this
    section, we’ll delve into Java’s approach to achieving this portability and explore
    its core concepts.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the heart of Java’s platform independence is the JVM. Java source code is
    compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the JVM. This bytecode can run on
    any platform with a compatible JVM, ensuring that Java applications are platform-independent.

    run it on any platform with a compatible JVM. This eliminates the need to rewrite
    code for different operating systems.

    bytecode is a platform-independent representation of the code and is saved in  .class
    files.

    of the JVM for various platforms. For example, Oracle provides the Oracle JVM,
    while OpenJDK offers an open-source alternative. These implementations ensure
    compatibility with specific operating systems.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '1\. Classes and Objects:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the heart of Java’s OOP paradigm are classes and objects. A class defines
    a blueprint for objects, specifying their attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '2\. Encapsulation:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Java encourages encapsulation, the practice of bundling data (fields) and methods
    that operate on that data within a single unit (class). This helps maintain data
    integrity and control access.

    to it is controlled through methods like  deposit and  getBalance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '3\. Inheritance:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inheritance allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the attributes
    and behaviors of another class (superclass or base class). Java supports single
    inheritance (a subclass can inherit from one superclass) and multiple interfaces
    (a class can implement multiple interfaces).
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a common superclass. It enables method overriding and dynamic method binding.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    based on essential attributes and behaviors. Abstract classes and interfaces are
    used to define abstractions in Java.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '2\. Reference Counting:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some programming languages, objects are tracked using reference counting,
    where each object keeps track of the number of references to it. When the reference
    count drops to zero, the object is considered no longer in use and can be deallocated.
  prefs: []

    technique because it cannot handle cyclic references efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '3\. Reachability Analysis:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Java employs reachability analysis to determine whether an object is still in
    use. An object is considered reachable if it can be accessed through references
    from the root set, which includes objects referenced by active threads, local
    variables, and static variables.
  prefs: []

    and  obj2.

- en: '4\. The Role of the Garbage Collector:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The garbage collector’s primary role is to identify and reclaim memory occupied
    by objects that are no longer reachable. It does this by periodically traversing
    the object graph from the root set and marking reachable objects. Unreachable
    objects are then deallocated, freeing up memory for future allocations.

    garbage collection using  System.gc() or  Runtime.getRuntime().gc(). However,
    it’s generally discouraged, as the JVM is typically more efficient at determining
    when to run the GC.

- en: A memory leak occurs when objects are unintentionally kept in memory because
    they are not properly dereferenced. Java’s garbage collector helps prevent memory
    leaks by reclaiming memory from unreachable objects. However, developers should
    be cautious with long-lived references to objects to avoid unintentional memory
    retention.

- en: Understanding how garbage collection works in Java is essential for writing
    efficient and memory-safe applications. Java’s automatic memory management system
    helps simplify memory handling, but developers should still be aware of best practices
    to ensure optimal memory usage and avoid memory leaks.
