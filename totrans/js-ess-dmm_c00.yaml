    that look amazing. But after you funnel your page to your web server and look
    at it a few (dozen) times, you may notice a subtle feeling of disappointment creeping
    in. Why? It can be hard to pin down, but that hint of dismay comes from a stark
    fact: Your web page just kind of sits there.'

    just take you to more of your pages that also just kind of sit there. Or maybe
    a link takes you to another site altogether, one that feels dynamic and alive
    and interactive. Ah, engagement! Ooh, excitement!

    to be always dancing? One word: JavaScript. If you want your pages to be dynamic

    language, for crying out loud!” I hear you. It’s true that anyone can learn HTML
    as long as they start with the basic tags, examine lots of examples of how they
    work, and slowly work their way up to more complex pages. It’s just a matter of
    creating a solid foundation and then building on it.

    not going to tell you that JavaScript is as easy to learn as HTML. That would
    be a bald-faced lie. However, I will tell you that there is nothing inherently
    difficult about JavaScript. I believe that if you begin with the basic syntax
    and rules, study tons of examples to learn how they work, and then slowly build
    up to more complex scripts, you can learn JavaScript programming. I predict here
    and now that by the time you finish this book, you’ll even be a little bit amazed
    at yourself and at what you can do.  ## About This Book'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Welcome, then, to *JavaScript Essentials For Dummies*. This book gives you a
    solid education on the standard programming language underlying the World Wide
    Web. You learn how to set up the tools you need and, given any web pages you have
    (or someone else has) built with HTML and CSS, you learn how to use JavaScript
    to program those pages. My goal is to show you that adding a sprinkling of JavaScript
    magic to a page isn’t hard to learn, and that even the greenest rookie programmer
    can learn how to create dynamic and interactive web pages that will amaze their
    family and friends (and themselves).

    and long-winded explanations of concepts, I’m sorry, but you won’t find it here.
    My philosophy throughout this book comes from Linus Torvalds, the creator of the
    Linux operating system: “Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” I explain what needs
    to be explained and then I move on without further ado (or, most of the time,
    without any ado at all) to examples and scripts that do more to illuminate a concept
    that any verbose explanations I could muster (and believe me, I can muster verbosity
    with the best of them).  ## Foolish Assumptions'

    From there, you can peruse the rest of the chapters as you see fit.
