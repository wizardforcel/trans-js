    that there’s something you need to do before you start optimizing your algorithm.

- en: The prerequisite to optimization is determining the efficiency of your current
    code. After all, it’s impossible to make an algorithm faster if you don’t know
    how fast it is now.

- en: By now, you have a thorough understanding of Big O notation and the various
    categories of Big O. Once you know what category of Big O your algorithm belongs
    to, you can begin optimizing.

    your current algorithm’s Big O as the “prereq.”
