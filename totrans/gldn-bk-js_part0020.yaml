    To ensure that your application runs efficiently and securely in a production
    environment, you must carefully consider configuration, deployment, continuous
    integration, and continuous monitoring. We'll explore how to configure and deploy
    JavaScript applications, implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
    (CI/CD) practices, and monitor and maintain your applications in production.
