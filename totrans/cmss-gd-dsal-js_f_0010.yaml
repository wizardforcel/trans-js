- en: You’ve got to read this book in order. In some books out there you can read
    each chapter independently and skip around a bit, but this isn’t one of them.
    Each chapter assumes you’ve read the previous ones, and the book is carefully
    constructed so you can ramp up your understanding as you proceed.

    don’t depend entirely on each other. The diagram below depicts which chapters
    are prerequisites for other chapters.

    wanted to. (Oh! And this diagram is based on a data structure called a tree. You’re
    going to learn about it in Chapter 15.)

- en: 'Another important note: to make this book easy to understand, I don’t always
    reveal everything about a particular concept when I first introduce it. Sometimes,
    the best way to break down a complex concept is to reveal a small piece of it
    and only reveal the next piece once the first piece has sunk in. If I define a
    particular term as such-and-such, don’t take that to be the textbook definition
    until you’ve completed the entire section on that topic.'

- en: 'It’s a trade-off: to make the book digestible, I’ve chosen to oversimplify
    certain concepts at first and clarify them over time rather than ensure that every
    sentence is completely, academically, accurate. But don’t worry too much, because
    by the end, you’ll see the entire accurate picture.'
