    a good reason for that: regular expressions are incredibly powerful at text processing.
    With regular expressions, you can greatly reduce the time and effort required
    for complex string parsing tasks that would otherwise take dozens of lines of
    code.'

    expression patterns whenever you need to process texts. JavaScript already provides
    excellent built-in tools that meet many of your text manipulation needs.

    in the book. Some examples may appear simple, but there’s a big difference between
    reading the code and being able to write it on your own.
