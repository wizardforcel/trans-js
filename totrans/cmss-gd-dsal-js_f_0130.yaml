    that all build upon a single concept—the `node`. As you’ll see shortly, `nodes`
    are pieces of data that may be dispersed throughout the computer’s memory. `Node`-based
    data structures offer new ways to organize and access data that provide a number
    of major performance advantages.

    data structure and the foundation for future chapters. You’ll discover that `linked
    lists` seem almost identical to `arrays` but come with their own set of trade-offs
    in efficiency that can give us a performance boost for certain situations.
