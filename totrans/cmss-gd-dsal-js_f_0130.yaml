- en: For the next several chapters, we’re going to explore a variety of data structures
    that all build upon a single concept—the node. As you’ll see shortly, nodes are
    pieces of data that may be dispersed throughout the computer’s memory. Node-based
    data structures offer new ways to organize and access data that provide a number
    of major performance advantages.

    data structure and the foundation for future chapters. You’ll discover that linked
    lists seem almost identical to arrays but come with their own set of trade-offs
    in efficiency that can give us a performance boost for certain situations.
