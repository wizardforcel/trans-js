- en: The array is one of the most basic data structures in computer science. I assume
    you’ve worked with arrays before, so you’re aware that an array is a list of data
    elements. The array is versatile and can serve as a useful tool in many situations,
    but let’s take a look at one quick example.

    I might buy at the supermarket. (You’ve got to try elderberries.)

    the array holds. Our grocery list array has a length of `5` since it contains
    five values.

- en: '`Read`: `Reading` refers to looking something up at a particular spot within
    the data structure. With an array, this means looking up a value at a particular
    index. For example, looking up which grocery item is located at index `2` would
    be reading from the array.'

    structure. With an array, this means looking to see if a particular value exists
    within the array and, if so, at which index. For example, looking up the index
    of `"dates"` in our grocery list would be searching the array.'

    an array, this means adding a new value to an additional slot within the array.
    If we were to add `"figs"` to our shopping list, we’d be inserting a new value
    into the array.'

    an array, this means removing one of the values from the array. For example, if
    we removed `"bananas"` from our grocery list, this value would be deleted from
    the array.'
