- en: React Router is a powerful library for adding client-side routing and navigation
    to your React applications. It allows you to create single-page applications (SPAs)
    with multiple views or pages that can be navigated seamlessly without full page
    reloads. In this chapter, we will explore how to set up and use React Router to
    create dynamic and responsive navigation in your React projects.

- en: React Router is a popular routing library for React applications that provides
    a declarative way to manage the application's URL and navigate between different
    views. It helps you build SPAs by rendering components based on the current URL,
    all while maintaining a smooth user experience.

    ourselves with some key concepts:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '1\. **Route**: A `Route` is a component provided by React Router that renders
    UI based on the current location. It matches a URL path to a specific component
    and renders that component when the path matches.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '2\. **BrowserRouter**: `BrowserRouter` is one of the router components that
    should be wrapped around your application. It uses HTML5 history''s pushState
    and replaceState methods to keep your UI in sync with the URL.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '3\. **Route Parameters**: Route parameters allow you to capture dynamic segments
    of the URL, making your routes more flexible. For example, you can have a route
    like `/users/:id`, where `:id` represents a parameter that can change.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '4\. **Link**: The `Link` component is used for navigation. It renders an anchor
    tag (`<a>`) with the appropriate URL and ensures that the entire page does not
    reload when navigating between views.'

    Router in a React application and create some navigation examples.
