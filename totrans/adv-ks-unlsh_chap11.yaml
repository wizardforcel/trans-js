    of this course is not to cover the `JavaScript` language in its entirety. Instead,
    it aims to cover the core topics that are often not understood well enough, especially
    by beginners. There is so much about `JavaScript` that couldnâ€™t be covered in
    this course. But with a solid understanding of its core topics, one can surely
    continue learning it further.
