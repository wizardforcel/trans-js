    of this course is not to cover the JavaScript language in its entirety. Instead,
    it aims to cover the core topics that are often not understood well enough, especially
    by beginners. There is so much about JavaScript that couldnâ€™t be covered in this
    course. But with a solid understanding of its core topics, one can surely continue
    learning it further.
