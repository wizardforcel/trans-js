- en: To use this book, you should already know basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS syntax.
    Use of HTML and CSS will be infrequent and fairly basic, and I’ll explain each
    JavaScript example in detail. So even if your knowledge is rusty, you’ll understand
    how the code works.

- en: To run the examples, you’ll need a JavaScript environment that supports the
    newest version of the ECMAScript standard (ECMAScript is the official standard
    that defines the specification of JavaScript). So, whether you’re running the
    examples in your browser’s console or the Node.js environment, make sure you have
    the latest software version installed.

- en: Certain recipes use APIs that are only available in the browser environment,
    such as fetch(). As a result, you can run those recipes only in a browser. We’ll
    warn you about the lack of browser/environment support whenever necessary.
