- en: Many regard regular expressions as the holy grail of text processing—a tool
    that can simplify numerous programming tasks and provide a compact, effective
    solution to various text processing problems. But should you shoehorn regular
    expressions into situations where standard built-in solutions already exist?

- en: Of course not. Regular expressions can be tricky to get right, and it’s too
    easy to end up with a pattern that accepts more input than intended. Code collaboration
    may also become an issue, as the cryptic nature of regular expressions may discourage
    your fellow programmers from reviewing or debugging your code. After all, nobody
    wants to spend a week trying to understand a twenty-line enigmatic string made
    of magical symbols.

- en: In part one of the book, we’ll delve into a collection of tiny programs demonstrating
    built-in string manipulation methods in JavaScript. You’ll discover what problems
    each method is designed to solve, and in doing so, you’ll learn in what situations
    they’re preferable to regular expressions.
