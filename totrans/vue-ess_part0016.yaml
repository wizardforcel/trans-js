- en: Code splitting is a powerful technique to enhance load times by deferring the
    loading of certain components until they are needed. In Vue.js, the import statement
    with a dynamic comment instructs Webpack to create a separate chunk for the specified
    component. This ensures that components are only loaded when they are required,
    contributing to a more performant PWA.

    Devtools. By adding the performance plugin to the Vue CLI, developers gain access
    to insightful metrics and visualizations that aid in identifying bottlenecks,
    optimizing components, and fine-tuning their Vue.js PWA for optimal performance.
