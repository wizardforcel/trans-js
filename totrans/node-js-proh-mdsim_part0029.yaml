- en: In the previous chapters, we covered the fundamentals of JavaScript, including
    variables, data types, functions, objects, events, and AJAX. Now, it's time to
    explore advanced JavaScript concepts that will take your skills to the next level.
    In this chapter, we'll delve into Promises, async/await, error handling techniques,
    and more.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Promises are a powerful tool in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations.
    They provide a cleaner and more intuitive way to manage asynchronous code compared
    to callbacks. A Promise represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous
    operation and allows us to chain multiple asynchronous operations together.

- en: In this example, we create a new Promise using the `new Promise()` constructor,
    passing it a callback function with `resolve` and `reject` parameters. Inside
    the callback function, we perform our asynchronous operation. If the operation
    is successful, we call `resolve(value)` with the desired value. If an error occurs,
    we call `reject(error)` with the corresponding error.

- en: We can chain `then()` methods to handle the resolved value and `catch()` methods
    to handle any errors that occur during the Promise chain.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Async/await is a more recent addition to JavaScript and provides a syntactic
    sugar on top of Promises. It allows us to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous
    and readable manner. Async/await makes working with Promises even more intuitive
    and reduces the need for explicit Promise chaining.

- en: 'To use async/await, we declare a function with the `async` keyword. Within
    the function, we can use the `await` keyword to pause the execution and wait for
    a Promise to resolve or reject. Here''s an example:'

- en: In this example, the `fetchData()` function is declared with the `async` keyword.
    Within the function, we use the `await` keyword to pause the execution and wait
    for the `fetch()` Promise to resolve. Once the Promise resolves, we assign the
    response to the `response` variable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then use `await` again to pause the execution and wait for the `response.json()`
    Promise to resolve. Once the Promise resolves, we assign the parsed data to the
    `data` variable and log it to the console.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Proper error handling is essential in any JavaScript application. When working
    with asynchronous code, it's crucial to handle errors effectively to ensure a
    smooth user experience and provide meaningful feedback.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In addition to the try/catch block demonstrated in the previous examples, we
    can also handle errors using the `catch()` method of Promises or by throwing custom
    errors. Here''s an example:'

- en: In this example, we define the `countUpTo()` generator function that generates
    numbers from 0 to `n`. Inside the function, we use the `yield` keyword to pause
    the execution and return the current value of `i`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We create an instance of the generator using `countUpTo(5)`. By calling the
    `next()` method on the generator, we can resume the execution and retrieve the
    next value in the sequence.

    and can be used in various scenarios to simplify complex logic.

    and effective user feedback. We touched on throwing custom errors, catching errors
    in Promise chains, and using try/catch blocks.

    to pause and resume their execution. Generators provide a flexible and expressive
    way to handle iterative algorithms and asynchronous tasks.
