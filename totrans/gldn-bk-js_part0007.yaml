    are fundamental to the logic of any programming language, allowing you to direct
    the flow of execution of your code in an intelligent and efficient way. In JavaScript,
    we have several control structures that help us make decisions and repeat actions
    according to specific conditions. Today, we''ll explore conditional structures,
    repetition structures, functions, and scope. Deepening our understanding of these
    topics is essential to writing clean, efficient code.'
