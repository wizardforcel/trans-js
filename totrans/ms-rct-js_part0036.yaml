    Thorough testing ensures the reliability and correctness of the application, while
    successful deployment makes the application accessible to users. In this chapter,
    we will explore the testing process, different types of testing, and the deployment
    strategies used to make applications available to users.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Testing plays a critical role in the development process to identify and fix
    bugs, ensure the application meets requirements, and maintain overall software
    quality. Testing helps prevent potential issues in production, reduces the cost
    of fixing defects, and boosts confidence in the application's performance.

- en: a. Unit Testing
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unit testing focuses on verifying the smallest units of an application, such
    as functions or methods, in isolation. Developers write unit tests to ensure that
    individual units behave as expected.

    Jest, a popular testing framework for JavaScript.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Integration testing verifies how different units of the application work together.
    It focuses on testing interactions between various components to identify issues
    that may arise due to the integration of these components.

    an integration test for an API endpoint in an Express application.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Functional testing evaluates the application's functionality from the end user's
    perspective. It tests the entire application, ensuring that it behaves correctly
    and meets the specified requirements.

    scalability under different conditions, such as heavy load or high traffic.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are development practices
    that aim to automate the testing and deployment processes, respectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a. Continuous Integration (CI)
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CI involves automatically merging code changes into a shared repository and
    running automated tests whenever new code is committed. This ensures that the
    application remains functional and free of regressions.

- en: b. Continuous Deployment (CD)
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CD takes automation one step further by automatically deploying code to production
    after passing all the required tests. It streamlines the deployment process, reducing
    the time between writing code and making it available to users.

- en: a. Blue-Green Deployment
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Blue-Green deployment, two identical environments (blue and green) are maintained.
    The current production environment (blue) serves the live application, while the
    new version of the application is deployed to the green environment. Once the
    green environment is tested and verified, the traffic is switched from blue to
    green, making the new version live.

- en: b. Canary Deployment
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Canary deployment involves deploying a new version of the application to a small
    subset of users (the canary group). This allows for testing the new version in
    production with limited impact. If the new version performs well, it can gradually
    be rolled out to a larger audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: c. Rolling Deployment
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Rolling deployment, the new version of the application is deployed incrementally
    to a subset of servers or instances at a time. This allows for a smooth transition
    between versions, reducing downtime and minimizing the impact on users.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Monitoring the application in production is crucial to identify performance
    issues, errors, and potential bottlenecks. Proper monitoring tools and error reporting
    mechanisms help maintain application health and provide insights for further improvements.

    the software development lifecycle. We learned about different types of testing,
    including unit testing, integration testing, functional testing, and performance
    testing, and how they help ensure the quality and reliability of the application.
