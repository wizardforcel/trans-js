    and repeat code execution. Now, we'll dive into functions, a fundamental concept
    in JavaScript. Functions are blocks of code that can be defined and executed multiple
    times. They play a crucial role in organizing and reusing code, making it more
    modular and maintainable. Additionally, we'll discuss scope, which defines the
    accessibility of variables within different parts of the code. Understanding functions
    and scope is essential for becoming a proficient JavaScript developer. Let's get
    started!

    name, a pair of parentheses, and a pair of curly braces that contain the function's
    code.

    side effects and to write clean and bug-free code. JavaScript has two main types

    to solve the issues with `var` hoisting. Variables declared with `let` and `const`
    have block scope, making them accessible only within the block where they are
    declared.

    in their lexical scope, even when they are executed outside that scope.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE

    lexical scope, even after the `outerFunction` has finished executing. The `closureFunction`
    carries the closure and can still access `outerVar`.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we explored functions and scope in JavaScript. Functions are
    reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, making code more organized
    and maintainable. We learned how to define and call functions, work with function
    parameters, use the `return` statement, and create anonymous and arrow functions.
    We also discussed scope, including global scope, local scope, nested scope, and
    block scope, as well as the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in terms
    of scoping.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding functions and scope is vital for writing efficient and robust
    JavaScript code. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller functions and organizing
    variables within appropriate scopes, we can build more scalable and maintainable
    applications. In the next chapter, we will explore objects and object-oriented
    programming in JavaScript, taking our coding skills to the next level. So, keep
    reading and keep coding to become a JavaScript master!
