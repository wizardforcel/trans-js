- en: This sequence begins with the numbers 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is
    the sum of the previous two numbers of the sequence. For example, the number 55
    was computed because it is the sum of the previous two numbers, which are 21 and
    34.

    For example, if we pass the number 10 to the function, it will return 55, as 55
    is the tenth number in the series. (The 0 is considered the 0th number in the
    series.)

    to `O(2^N)`。Indeed, all the recursive calls made by `fib(6)` are shown in the

    a variable. We need to calculate both `fib(n - 2)` and `fib(n - 1)` (as each Fibonacci
    number is the sum of those two numbers), and storing the result of one won’t alone
    give us the result for the other.

- en: When a problem is solved by solving smaller versions of the same problem, the
    smaller problem is called a subproblem. This concept isn’t new—we’ve been dealing
    with it frequently throughout our discussion of recursion. In the case of the
    Fibonacci sequence, we compute each number by first computing the smaller numbers
    in the sequence. The computations of these smaller numbers are the subproblems.

- en: What makes these subproblems overlapping, though, is the fact that `fib(n -
    2)` and `fib(n - 1)` end up calling many of the same functions as each other.
    Specifically, `fib(n - 1)` ends up making some of the very same calculations already
    made by `fib(n - 2)`. For example, you can see in the previous diagram that `fib(5)`
    calls `fib(3)` even though `fib(4)` has itself already done so. Many other calls
    are duplicated too.

    make many overlapping function calls, and our algorithm oozes along at a pace
    of `O(2^N)`. There’s just nothing we can do.
