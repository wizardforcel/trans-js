- en: Each time I complete a book, the publisher sends me a heavy box filled with
    a few so-called “author” copies. Opening that box, lifting out a book, feeling
    the satisfying weight of something that has, up to now, been weightlessly digital,
    and seeing my name printed on the cover, well, it’s a pretty fine feeling, let
    me tell you. That’s pretty cool, but you know what’s *really* cool? That I’ve
    done that over a hundred times in my writing career, and seeing my name on the
    cover has *never* gotten old.

- en: But just because mine is the only name you see on the cover, doesn’t mean this
    book was a one-man show. Far from it. Sure, I did write this book’s text and take
    its screenshots, but those represent only a part of what constitutes a “book.”
    The rest of it is brought to you by the dedication and professionalism of Wiley’s
    editing, graphics, and production teams, who toiled long and hard to turn my text
    and images into an actual book.
