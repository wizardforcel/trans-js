- en: In this chapter, we will put our knowledge of Node.js modules and the Node Package
    Manager (NPM) to practical use by building a blogging application. We'll create
    a simple yet functional application that allows users to create, read, update,
    and delete blog posts. Let's dive into the exciting world of building web applications
    with Node.js!

    views of our application. These files will be rendered by the server when the
    corresponding routes are accessed.

    a `create.html` file for creating a new blog post, an `update.html` file for updating

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we laid the foundation for our blogging application by setting
    up the project, configuring the Express server, defining routes, and creating
    views. We also learned how to connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

    the functionality to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. We'll transform
    our blogging application from a skeleton into a fully functional web application.
