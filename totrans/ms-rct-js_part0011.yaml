- en: Forms are a fundamental part of web applications, allowing users to input data,
    submit information, and interact with websites. React provides powerful tools
    for working with forms, including controlled components, form submission, validation,
    and handling user input. In this chapter, we'll explore how to create and manage
    forms in React, and we'll provide examples to illustrate these concepts.

- en: 'In React, forms are created using HTML form elements, such as `<form>`, `<input>`,
    `<textarea>`, and `<select>`. However, React adds a layer of abstraction to handle
    form data and user interactions efficiently. When working with forms in React,
    you''ll often encounter the following concepts:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Controlled components are React components that render form elements and manage
    their state through React's component state. This means that the value of the
    form element is controlled by the component's state, and any changes to the input
    value are reflected in the state and vice versa.

- en: In this example, the `<input>` element's value is controlled by the `inputValue`
    state. When the user types in the input field, the `handleChange` method updates
    the state, ensuring that the input value is always in sync with the component's
    state.

- en: Form Submission
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: React handles form submission by listening to the `onSubmit` event of the `<form>`
    element. When the form is submitted, an event handler function is called, allowing
    you to access and process the form data.

    and we can perform data processing or send the form data to a server.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Form validation is the process of ensuring that user input meets specific criteria
    or constraints. React allows you to implement form validation by adding conditional
    logic to your event handlers, checking the input data, and providing feedback
    to the user.

    an error message if it's less than 5 characters. The error message is updated
    as the user types, providing real-time feedback.

    users to enter their name and email address. When the user submits the form, we'll
    display a greeting message with the provided name and email.

    error messages dynamically.'
