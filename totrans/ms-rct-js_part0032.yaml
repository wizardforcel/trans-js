- en: In Chapter 10, we explored modern JavaScript features introduced in ES6 and
    beyond, which have greatly improved the language's expressiveness and maintainability.
    Now, let's dive into the world of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs
    allow different software systems to communicate and interact with each other,
    enabling developers to access and use external services, data, or functionality
    in their applications. Working with APIs is a fundamental skill for web developers,
    as it allows them to integrate powerful services, fetch data from remote servers,
    and build dynamic and feature-rich web applications. In this chapter, we will
    explore the concepts of APIs, how to interact with them, and how to consume data
    using various methods.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols
    that allows different software systems to communicate with each other. APIs define
    the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange
    information. APIs can be used to interact with remote servers, access databases,
    integrate third-party services, and perform various other tasks.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Web APIs are APIs that are exposed over the internet and can be accessed using
    HTTP requests. These APIs are commonly used in web development to fetch data,
    perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and interact with various
    services.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing
    networked applications. RESTful APIs adhere to the principles of REST and use
    standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    information in the implementation of web services. SOAP APIs use XML to represent
    data and rely on the HTTP protocol for communication.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the
    data they need. Unlike traditional REST APIs, GraphQL APIs allow clients to specify
    the exact data they want to retrieve, making them more efficient and flexible.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When interacting with an API, developers send requests to the API's endpoints,
    specifying the desired operation and any required data. The API processes the
    request and sends back a response, which contains the requested data or information
    about the success or failure of the operation.
