    and libraries. These features are powerful tools that help simplify and organize
    web application development, allowing you to focus on business logic and user
    experience. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the main frameworks
    (`React`，`Angular`，`Vue.js`)，compare them, and discuss when and why to use a framework.'

    It is based on components, which are reusable blocks of code that manage their
    own state and logic. One of the main concepts of `React` is `Virtual DOM`，which
    improves performance by minimizing direct manipulations of the real `DOM`。'
