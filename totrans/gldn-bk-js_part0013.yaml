    and libraries. These features are powerful tools that help simplify and organize
    web application development, allowing you to focus on business logic and user
    experience. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the main frameworks
    (React, Angular, Vue.js), compare them, and discuss when and why to use a framework.'

- en: React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for creating user interfaces.
    It is based on components, which are reusable blocks of code that manage their
    own state and logic. One of the main concepts of React is Virtual DOM, which improves
    performance by minimizing direct manipulations of the real DOM.

    time the button is clicked, the counter is incremented and the interface is automatically
    updated.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Angular is a complete framework developed by Google for creating robust and
    complex web applications. It uses TypeScript, a JavaScript-based language that
    adds optional static typing. Angular is known for its module architecture and
    dependency injection, which makes code organization and testing easier.

    to be scalable, meaning you can use it to add interactivity to an existing page
    or to build complex single-page applications (SPA). Vue is known for its simplicity
    and ease of integration.

    Performance can be optimized with techniques such as using `shouldComponentUpdate`
    and React.memo.'

    like components, state, and lifecycle, but the library is relatively easy to get
    started with.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    TypeScript. Requires a good understanding of concepts such as dependency injection
    and decorators.'

    and Vue.js, and discuss when and why to use them. Understanding the characteristics
    and strengths of each of these frameworks allows you to make informed decisions
    about which tool is best suited for your project. As you continue your web development
    journey, mastering these frameworks and libraries will be essential to creating
    modern, efficient, and scalable applications. Continue exploring, practicing,
    and applying these concepts to become an expert in the art of web programming
    with JavaScript.
