    how to create them, and how to pass data via props and manage state. In this chapter,
    we will delve deeper into the concepts of state and props in React, exploring
    their roles, differences, and best practices for using them effectively. By mastering
    state and props, you'll be well-equipped to build dynamic and interactive user
    interfaces with React.
