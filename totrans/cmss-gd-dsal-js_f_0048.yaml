- en: We’ve seen that Big O notation is a great tool for comparing algorithms and
    determining which algorithm should be used for a given situation. However, it’s
    certainly not the only tool. In fact, there may be times when two competing algorithms
    are described in the same way using Big O, yet one algorithm is faster than the
    other.

    that seem to have the same efficiency and how to select the faster of the two.
