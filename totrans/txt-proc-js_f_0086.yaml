    pattern fails to work as expected. Tracking down and fixing errors in regex can
    be a systematic process. Let’s quickly go over some strategies to assist you in
    troubleshooting and resolving issues when your pattern isn’t working as intended:'

- en: 'When making a decision on whether to use a regex or an alternative solution,
    two main factors come into play: performance and maintainability. Regular expressions
    can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large inputs or
    complex patterns. If performance is a critical factor for your task, and regex
    is causing performance issues, you might need to consider alternative solutions,
    such as string manipulation functions or specialized parsing libraries.'

- en: To identify if a regex is causing performance problems for your app, measure
    the execution time of your code. You can use built-in timing functions or performance
    profiling tools. Compare the execution time with and without the regex to see
    if there is a significant difference.

- en: If you have identified that the regex is the culprit, consider optimizing it
    before searching for an alternative solution. Look for opportunities to simplify
    or refactor the regex pattern. For example, try to eliminate unnecessary capturing
    groups and use more specific expressions whenever possible.

- en: Another consideration is whether your code will be maintained by others. Regular
    expressions can become convoluted and hard to understand, particularly for complex
    patterns. So, opting for a more explicit solution might be preferable. It’s essential
    to weigh the trade-offs and choose the most appropriate solution based on the
    specific requirements of your project.

    role in many applications such as natural language processing, machine learning,
    information retrieval, and data analysis. In this book, we have explored both
    traditional and state-of-the-art approaches to text processing in JavaScript.
