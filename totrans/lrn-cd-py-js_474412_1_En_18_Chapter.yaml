    The website is operated by the `Python Software Foundation`, the organization
    that coordinates the further development of Python. On the website, under “Downloads,”
    simply choose the latest Python version for your operating system. We’re working
    with `Python` for `Windows` here in the book, but everything we’ll discuss here
    applies to the `macOS` and `Linux` versions in much the same way. The `Python`
    that you then install is called `CPython`, the “official” Python version, if you
    will, in whose development Python inventor `Guido van Rossum` is involved. In
    addition, there are numerous other Python implementations. There are even Python
    interpreters that are written in Python themselves! `CPython`, on the other hand,
    was developed in the `C` programming language. And it is exactly this `CPython`
    that you are downloading now, even though it is not listed under this name on
    the ► [python.​org](http://python.org) website.

    on the screen. Make a note of the path where `Python` will be installed. You do
    not need to change anything in the default settings that the setup program provides.
    The installation is usually complete within a few minutes.

    warnings, and other output are only generated in English; the Python programming
    language also uses only English terms. In this respect, you didn’t miss the dialog
    where you can select the language during installation, because there isn’t one!
    Apart from that, it is recommended to install the English version of all tools
    anyway, because this makes it much easier to search for help on the Internet if
    you don’t understand an error message or want to find out how to perform a certain
    operation with the tool.

    website. This is limited in functionality, but already offers considerably more
    features than we will ever be able to use in this book. Click the “Download” button
    and then choose your operating system; Windows, MacOS and Linux are supported.
    After downloading the setup program, start the installation process. You can leave
    the default settings here as well; however, it is recommended to at least associate
    `.py` files with `PyCharm` in the "Create Associations" section of the installer,
    so that they are always opened automatically with the IDE from now on. The installation
    usually does not take long but requires over 1.6 GB of free hard disk space. The
    times when you could install MS-DOS development environments from three or four
    3.5-inch floppy disks with 1.44 MB capacity each are definitely over!

    section whether you want to use the dark or the light color scheme. All illustrations
    in this book were created in the light color scheme for better printability; however,
    the author otherwise works in dark mode, which is a little less straining on the
    eyes. It’s best to exit `PyCharm` at this point first by closing the dialog. In
    the next chapter, we will start our first Python project. Then we will continue
    at this point.

    wonder that you can find countless resources around Python on the internet. One
    of these resources is the aforementioned platform `Stack Overflow`, where you’ll
    find a ton of Python questions and answers that leave little to be desired. As
    of this writing, there are more than 2.1 million questions tagged `Python` on
    `Stack Overflow.` Today alone, 1,039 have been added. The probability that your
    question is also among the 2 million should be high. Therefore, `Stack Overflow`
    is a good place to start for most questions. The `Stack Overflow` hits are also
    regularly listed among the top search results on Google. You can, of course, add
    the `site` keyword to the Google search (`site:`► [`StackOverflow.com`](http://stackoverflow.com))
    to narrow the search to `Stack Overflow`. But even beyond `Stack Overflow`, the
    internet is full of posts, blogs, tutorials, videos, and every other content format
    imaginable related to Python.

    by calling the `help(element)` function in the Python console and giving it as
    an argument the name of the module, package, class, or function for which you
    want to see information. For example, calling `help(print)` returns the following
    help information:'

    the `>>>` as this is the prompt, indicating that the console is ready to accept
    your input. By the way, if you type `help()` without an argument, the console
    switches to the Python help system. The modified prompt `help>` indicates that
    you can now enter terms, which will then display matching help entries. You can
    leave the help system and return to the Python console by typing `quit` (without
    brackets).

    of the `print()` function are, and most importantly, what `print()` does in the

    it is best to search the Internet yourself.

    The “Language Reference” explains the structure and syntax of the language, but
