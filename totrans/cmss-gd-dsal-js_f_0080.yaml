    value. Let’s see how this works with our `Quickasaurus` example hash table.

    placement of each value is determined by its key; that is, by hashing the key
    itself, we compute the index number where the key’s associated value should be
    placed.

- en: Because the key determines the placement of the value, we use this principle
    to make lookups a cinch. When we have any key and want to find its value, the
    key itself tells us where the value will be found. Just as we hashed the key to
    insert the value in the appropriate cell, we can hash the key again to find where
    we previously put that value.

    it’s a process that takes a constant amount of time. The computer hashes the key,
    turns it into a number, and jumps to the index with that number to retrieve the
    value stored there.'

    menu than an array. With an array, when we look up the price of a menu item, we
    would have to search through each cell until we find it. For an unordered array,
    this would take up to O(N), and for an ordered array, this would take up to O(log
    N). Using a hash table, however, we can now use the actual menu items as keys,
    allowing us to do a hash table lookup of O(1). And that’s the beauty of a hash
    table.

- en: It’s important to point out that the ability to find any value within the hash
    table in a single step only works if we know the value’s key. If we tried to find
    a particular value without knowing its key, we’d still have to resort to searching
    each and every key-value pair within the hash table, which is O(N).

- en: Similarly, we can only do O(1) lookups when using a key to find the value. If,
    on the other hand, we want to use a value to find its associated key, we can’t
    take advantage of the hash table’s fast lookup ability.

- en: 'This is because the whole premise of the hash table is that the key determines
    the value’s location. But this premise only works in one direction: we use the
    key to find the value. If we only had a value in hand, and wanted to find its
    corresponding key, we’d have no way to quickly access that key. We’d have no choice
    but to comb through the entire hash table to look for the key, as the value gives
    us no info as to what its key is or where we could find it.'

    only saw how the values are stored in the `hash table`.

    keys next to the values themselves. This is useful in case of collisions, which
    I’ll discuss in the next section.

    worth noting. Each key can exist only once in the `hash table`, but there can
    be multiple instances of a value.

    have the `hamburger` listed twice (nor would we want to, as it only has one price).
    However, we could have multiple foods that cost `$2.50`.

    exists, it simply overwrites the old value while keeping the same key.
