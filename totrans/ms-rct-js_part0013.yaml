- en: In modern web development, applications often rely on external data sources
    to provide dynamic content and functionality. This external data is typically
    obtained through the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). In this
    chapter, we'll explore the process of working with APIs and fetching data in a
    React application.

- en: An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications
    to communicate with each other. In the context of web development, APIs are commonly
    used to request and exchange data between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a
    server (e.g., a web server or a third-party service).

    around a set of architectural principles. They use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT,
    DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
    REST APIs are widely used for web services.'

- en: '2\. **GraphQL APIs**: GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients
    to request only the data they need. Unlike REST APIs, which have predefined endpoints
    and return fixed data structures, GraphQL APIs enable clients to define the shape
    and structure of the response.'

    corresponds to a particular resource or functionality provided by the API. For
    example, a weather API might have endpoints for retrieving current conditions,
    forecasts, and historical data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fetching data from APIs is a fundamental part of building dynamic and data-driven
    React applications. By understanding the basics of APIs, making HTTP requests,
    and managing data within your components, you can create web applications that
    provide real-time information and interactivity to users. As you continue to develop
    your React skills, mastering data fetching will enable you to build more complex
    and feature-rich applications.
