    a new category of algorithmic efficiency in the world of Big O. To demonstrate
    it, we’ll get to use one of the classic algorithms of computer-science lore.

- en: In this chapter and those following, we’re going to encounter a number of these
    sorting algorithms. Some of the first ones you’ll learn about are known as simple
    sorts, in that they are easy to understand but are not as efficient as some of
    the faster sorting algorithms out there.

- en: Repeat Steps 1 through 3 until we reach the end of the array, or if we reach
    the values that have already been sorted. (This will make more sense in the walk-through
    that follows.) At this point, we’ve completed our first pass-through of the array—we
    “passed through” the array by pointing to each of its values until we reached
    the end.

    execute another pass-through of the array by running Steps 1 through 4 again.
    We keep on executing these pass-throughs until we have a pass-through in which
    we did not perform any swaps. When this happens, it means our array is fully sorted
    and our work is done.
