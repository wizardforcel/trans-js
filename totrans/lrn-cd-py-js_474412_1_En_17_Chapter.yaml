- en: Now we will start learning `Python`, our first programming language. As we learn,
    we will be guided by the 9 questions around the basic concepts of programming
    that we learned in the previous part. However, we will start with an overview
    of the origins and development of `Python`, its popularity and use.

- en: '`Python` was developed by Dutch mathematician and computer scientist `Guido
    van Rossum` starting in late 1989, apparently, out of boredom over the Christmas
    holidays (what do *you* do at Christmas?) The name is based on `Van Rossum`’s
    beloved British comedy troupe `Monty Python`, so it has nothing to do with the
    snake whose stylized image can be seen in the `Python` logo.'

- en: 'The hobby project of `Guido van Rossum` has long since become one of the most
    popular programming languages around. Two of many indicators of this are `Python`’s
    positioning in the `TIOBE index` (May 2023: 1st place, followed by `C` and `Java`)
    and the over 2 million question posts on `Stack Overflow`. For practically all
    internet and tech giants like `Google` or `Amazon`, `Python` is now one of the
    languages in constant use.'

- en: '`Python` is a general-purpose language and is accordingly used for a wide variety
    of purposes, including—not least due to frameworks such as `Django`—applications
    on the web. `Python` has become extremely popular thanks to extension libraries
    such as `NumPy` for Data Science, and seems to be the de facto standard language
    for applications in the field of artificial intelligence, for which some significant
    `Python` extensions are available with libraries such as `TensorFlow` and `Keras`.'

- en: The popularity of `Python` is due in part to the fact that the language is relatively
    easy to learn. `Python` has a simple and straightforward syntax and encourages
    the development of easily understandable program code. Because of this, `Python`
    is considered by many to be the best beginner programming language. Numerous people,
    and you seem to be no exception, are taking their first steps towards programming
    today with the programming language originally developed as `Van Rossum`’s hobby
    project.

- en: Of course, `Python` has not been a hobby project for a long time. Since 2001,
    the `Python Software Foundation` has been the non-profit organization that takes
    care of the maintenance and further development of `Python`. Until a few years
    ago, `Guido van Rossum` played the leading role in this organization, which is
    why he was occasionally referred to as the “benevolent dictator for life”. By
    now, however, he has largely withdrawn from the activities.

- en: 'The goal in this part of the book is not for you to write Python programs that
    are as efficient as possible, which every Python expert admires, or to make your
    programs look as `pythonic` as possible, but rather for you to learn how to write
    `functioning` Python programs that you `understand yourself` and that `fulfill
    their purpose`. After all, that''s what programming is ultimately about: solving
    a given problem. The solution must work; if it also happens to be particularly
    elegant, very nice, but if not, that''s fine too.'

- en: 'One tip before we really start: Try things out! Try not only to follow the
    examples presented in the text and the exercises, but also try things out for
    yourself, off the beaten path that the book gives you. You won’t learn as much
    from anything else as by simply asking yourself the questions: What actually happens
    if I do this and that slightly differently? Curiosity and the willingness to try
    new things yourself will make learning any new programming language immensely
    easier. And Python is perfect for trying things out on your own.'
