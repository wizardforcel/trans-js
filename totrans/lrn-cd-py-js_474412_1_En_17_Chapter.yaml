    we will be guided by the 9 questions around the basic concepts of programming
    that we learned in the previous part. However, we will start with an overview
    of the origins and development of `Python`, its popularity and use.

- en: '`Python` was developed by Dutch mathematician and computer scientist `Guido
    van Rossum` starting in late 1989, apparently, out of boredom over the Christmas
    holidays (what do *you* do at Christmas?) The name is based on `Van Rossum`’s
    beloved British comedy troupe `Monty Python`, so it has nothing to do with the
    snake whose stylized image can be seen in the `Python` logo.'

  zh: '`Python`由荷兰数学家和计算机科学家`Guido van Rossum`于1989年底开始开发，显然是由于圣诞假期期间的无聊（你在圣诞节做什么？）。这个名字源自`Van
    Rossum`喜爱的英国喜剧团体`Monty Python`，因此与标志中可以看到的蛇形图案没有任何关系。'
- en: 'The hobby project of `Guido van Rossum` has long since become one of the most
    popular programming languages around. Two of many indicators of this are `Python`’s
    positioning in the `TIOBE index` (May 2023: 1st place, followed by `C` and `Java`)
    and the over 2 million question posts on `Stack Overflow`. For practically all
    internet and tech giants like `Google` or `Amazon`, `Python` is now one of the
    languages in constant use.'

    Overflow`上的超过200万个问题帖，都是这一点的两个例证。对于几乎所有互联网和科技巨头，如`Google`或`Amazon`，`Python`现在是常用的编程语言之一。'
- en: '`Python` is a general-purpose language and is accordingly used for a wide variety
    of purposes, including—not least due to frameworks such as `Django`—applications
    on the web. `Python` has become extremely popular thanks to extension libraries
    such as `NumPy` for Data Science, and seems to be the de facto standard language
    for applications in the field of artificial intelligence, for which some significant
    `Python` extensions are available with libraries such as `TensorFlow` and `Keras`.'

- en: The popularity of `Python` is due in part to the fact that the language is relatively
    easy to learn. `Python` has a simple and straightforward syntax and encourages
    the development of easily understandable program code. Because of this, `Python`
    is considered by many to be the best beginner programming language. Numerous people,
    and you seem to be no exception, are taking their first steps towards programming
    today with the programming language originally developed as `Van Rossum`’s hobby
    project.

    Rossum`的业余项目开发的编程语言，迈出编程的第一步。'
- en: Of course, `Python` has not been a hobby project for a long time. Since 2001,
    the `Python Software Foundation` has been the non-profit organization that takes
    care of the maintenance and further development of `Python`. Until a few years
    ago, `Guido van Rossum` played the leading role in this organization, which is
    why he was occasionally referred to as the “benevolent dictator for life”. By
    now, however, he has largely withdrawn from the activities.

  zh: 当然，`Python`早已不再是一个业余项目。从2001年起，`Python软件基金会`成为负责`Python`的维护和进一步开发的非营利组织。直到几年前，`Guido
    van Rossum`一直在该组织中担任领导角色，因此他曾被偶尔称为“终身仁慈独裁者”。然而，如今他已大部分退出了相关活动。
- en: 'The goal in this part of the book is not for you to write Python programs that
    are as efficient as possible, which every Python expert admires, or to make your
    programs look as `pythonic` as possible, but rather for you to learn how to write
    `functioning` Python programs that you `understand yourself` and that `fulfill
    their purpose`. After all, that''s what programming is ultimately about: solving
    a given problem. The solution must work; if it also happens to be particularly
    elegant, very nice, but if not, that''s fine too.'

  zh: 本书这一部分的目标并不是让你编写出每个 Python 专家都钦佩的尽可能高效的 Python 程序，或者让你的程序看起来尽可能“**Pythonic**”，而是让你学习如何编写出你自己能理解并且“**能正常运行**”的
    Python 程序，而且这些程序能“**实现它们的目的**”。毕竟，编程的最终目的是：解决给定的问题。解决方案必须有效；如果它恰好特别优雅，那当然很好，但如果不是，也没关系。
- en: 'One tip before we really start: Try things out! Try not only to follow the
    examples presented in the text and the exercises, but also try things out for
    yourself, off the beaten path that the book gives you. You won’t learn as much
    from anything else as by simply asking yourself the questions: What actually happens
    if I do this and that slightly differently? Curiosity and the willingness to try
    new things yourself will make learning any new programming language immensely
    easier. And Python is perfect for trying things out on your own.'

  zh: 在我们真正开始之前有一个小建议：动手试试！不仅要跟随书中的示例和练习，也要尝试自己做一些不拘一格的事情，走出书本给你的捷径。你从任何其他事情中学到的东西，都不如通过问自己这个问题学得多：“如果我稍微改变这样那样的做法，究竟会发生什么？”好奇心和尝试新事物的意愿会让你学习任何新编程语言变得轻松得多。而
    Python 是一个非常适合自己动手试验的语言。
