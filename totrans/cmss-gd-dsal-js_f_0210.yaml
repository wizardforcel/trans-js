- en: This algorithm is one of O(N), with N being the size of the array. While there
    are two distinct loops that process the N elements, this is simply 2N, which is
    reduced to O(N) after dropping the constants.

- en: This algorithm is one of O(N), with N being the size of the array. Within the
    loop, we run three steps, which means our algorithm takes 3N steps. However, this
    is reduced to O(N) when we eliminate the constants.

- en: This algorithm is one of O(N²), with N being the size of the array. While we
    only run the inner loop half of the time, this simply means that the algorithm
    runs for N² / 2 steps. However, the division by 2 is a constant, so we express
    this simply as O(N²).
