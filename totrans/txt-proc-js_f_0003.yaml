- en: While it would be easy for a book like Text Processing with JavaScript to spend
    all of its time on regular expressions, here you’ll also find ample discussion
    and useful examples of humble, often-overlooked, and computationally less expensive
    string methods in JavaScript. Whatever your text-processing task, this book will
    point you to the right API for the job. And even readers who might not be doing
    heavy-duty text processing will benefit from the coverage here of multi-byte character
    sets and presentations of various non-Western-Latin alphabets, including emoji,
    which is a tremendously useful resource in its own right.

- en: A handful of domain-specific languages exist that richly reward the software
    developers who master them. For DevOps engineers, the key DSL is bash; for backend
    engineers, it’s SQL; and for frontend and full-stack engineers, it’s regular expressions.
    Expertly wielding any of these languages is a superpower. Text Processing with
    JavaScript showcases how to harness the power of the JavaScript string type, diving
    deeply into all its aspects. Even developers with years of JavaScript experience
    will discover something new in its pages. With detailed coverage of various native
    text processing APIs, meticulous examples of regular expression techniques, and
    insightful code explanations, this book deserves a place on every frontend developer’s
    bookshelf.
