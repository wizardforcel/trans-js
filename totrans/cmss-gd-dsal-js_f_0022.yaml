- en: Analyzing the number of steps an operation takes is the heart of understanding
    the performance of data structures. Choosing the right data structure for your
    program can spell the difference between bearing a heavy load versus collapsing
    under it. In this chapter, you’ve learned to use this analysis to weigh whether
    an array or a set might be the appropriate choice for a given application.

    structures, we can use the same analysis to compare competing algorithms (even
    within the same data structure) to ensure the ultimate speed and performance of
    our code. And that’s exactly what the next chapter is about.
