    but are you sure you aren’t just shoehorning them in where standard built-in solutions
    already exist and would work better? JavaScript itself provides programmers with
    excellent methods for text manipulation, and knowing how and when to use them
    will help you write more efficient and performant code. From extracting data from
    APIs to calculating word counts and everything in between, discover how to pick
    the right tool for the job and make the absolute most of it every single time.

    know that all the best features of your operating system are hidden behind a user
    interface designed to help average people use the computer. But you’re not the
    average user, and the `CLI` is the most efficient way to get work done fast. Turn
    tedious chores into quick tasks: read and write files, manage complex directory
    hierarchies, perform network diagnostics, download files, work with `APIs`, and
    combine individual programs to create your own workflows. Put down that mouse,
    open the `CLI`, and take control of your software development environment.'

    of `import maps`. The result is a toolkit so powerful that it allows a single
    individual to create modern applications upon which they can build a competitive
    business. The way it used to be.'
