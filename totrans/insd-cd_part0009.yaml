- en: Data types are a fundamental concept in programming languages. They define the
    kind of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it.
    While different programming languages may have their own data types, there are
    common primitive data types that exist across many languages. In this section,
    we’ll explore these primitive data types and how they are represented in various
    languages.

- en: Java’s Collections Framework provides efficient data structures like ArrayLists,
    HashMaps, and LinkedLists. Choosing the right data structure for a specific task
    can significantly impact performance. ArrayLists, for instance, are efficient
    for random access, while LinkedLists are suitable for frequent insertions and
    deletions.
