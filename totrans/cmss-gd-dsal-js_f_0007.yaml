- en: All the code in this book is written in `JavaScript`. The original edition of
    this book, `A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms` (the second
    edition of which was published in 2020), was language-agnostic; it was written
    using multiple programming languages. The idea behind this was that we didn’t
    want to imply that the book would only be helpful for one language, given that
    data structures and algorithms are concepts that apply across all of computing
    in general.

    love to see language-specific editions of the book. After all, if you’re working
    with one particular programming language, wouldn’t it be nice to have a book in
    which all of the code is in that language?

    Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms`. The first of these was the Python version,
    published in 2023\. The second version is the JavaScript edition and is what you’re
    reading now!

    is the first volume in a progression of books. In this volume, I lay the foundation
    for these concepts and cover the most common data structures and algorithms. In
    the next volume, I’ll build upon this knowledge to level up further with more
    advanced ideas and techniques.
