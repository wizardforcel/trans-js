- en: In this chapter, we will explore JavaScript modules and modular development.
    Modules allow us to organize our code into reusable and encapsulated units, making
    our codebase more maintainable and scalable. We'll cover the basics of modules,
    module syntax, exporting and importing, as well as some best practices for modular
    development.

- en: JavaScript modules are self-contained units of code that can be exported and
    imported to be used in other parts of our application. They provide a way to encapsulate
    related functionality, variables, and classes, preventing them from polluting
    the global namespace and promoting code reusability.

- en: Prior to the introduction of native modules in JavaScript, developers used various
    module systems, such as CommonJS and AMD, to achieve modular development. However,
    with the release of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), native support for modules was introduced,
    making it easier to work with modules without the need for third-party libraries
    or frameworks.

- en: In ES6 modules, we use the `export` and `import` keywords to define what parts
    of a module should be accessible outside the module and to import those exported
    entities into other modules.

    variables, functions, classes, or even a default export. Here''s an example:'

    export function `greet()`. The default export is denoted by using the `export
    default` syntax.

    specific entities, all entities as a namespace, or the default export. Here''s
    how we can import entities from the `module.js` module:'

    the `module.js` module. We can then use these imported entities in our `main.js`
    module.

    to ensure clean and maintainable code:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Keep modules focused: Each module should have a single responsibility or
    focus on a specific feature. This helps in keeping the codebase organized and
    makes it easier to understand and maintain.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Use explicit exports: Instead of relying on the default export, it''s recommended
    to explicitly export the entities you want to expose from your module. This makes
    it clear which entities are intended to be used by other modules.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Use default exports sparingly: Default exports can be useful in certain scenarios,
    but they should be used sparingly. Using named exports makes it easier to understand
    what is being imported from a module.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Minimize module dependencies: Avoid creating modules with excessive dependencies
    on other modules. This reduces the risk of circular dependencies and simplifies
    the process of refactoring or removing a module.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Be mindful of the module size: While modules promote code organization, it''s
    also important to strike a balance and avoid creating overly large modules. If
    a module becomes too large or complex, consider refactoring it into smaller, more
    focused modules.'

    code is maintainable, reusable, and easily understandable.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JavaScript modules can be used in different environments, such as web browsers
    and Node.js. However, the specific module syntax and features supported may vary
    depending on the environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In web browsers, the native module system is supported in modern browsers. However,
    if you need to support older browsers or have more complex needs, you may need
    to use a bundler like webpack or Rollup to transpile and bundle your modules into
    a single JavaScript file that is compatible with older browsers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Node.js, the CommonJS module system is traditionally used. However, starting
    from Node.js version 12, support for ECMAScript modules (ESM) has been added,
    allowing you to use native module syntax in your Node.js applications.

- en: When working with modules, there are also various tools and frameworks available
    that provide additional features and optimizations. Some popular ones include
    TypeScript, Babel, and Parcel. These tools can enhance your development workflow
    and enable you to leverage advanced module capabilities.

- en: JavaScript modules play a vital role in modern JavaScript development. They
    allow us to write modular, reusable code and prevent global namespace pollution.
    By leveraging the `export` and `import` keywords, we can define the parts of our
    modules that should be accessible to other modules and easily import them as needed.

    programming in JavaScript, taking our code organization and reusability to the
    next level.
