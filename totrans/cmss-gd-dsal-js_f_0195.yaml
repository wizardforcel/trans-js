- en: We’ve come a long way. You now have the tools to analyze the time and space
    complexity of algorithms across a wide variety of data structures. With these
    concepts, you’re now able to write code that is fast, memory-efficient, and beautiful.

- en: In this final chapter of our journey, I’d like to leave you with some additional
    techniques for optimizing code. Sometimes it’s difficult to see how an algorithm
    can be improved. Over the years, I’ve found the following mental strategies help
    me see how I can make my code more efficient. I hope they’ll be helpful to you
    as well.
