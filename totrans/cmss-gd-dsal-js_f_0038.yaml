- en: With Big O notation, we have a consistent system that allows us to compare any
    two algorithms. With it, we’ll be able to examine real-life scenarios and choose
    between competing data structures and algorithms to make our code faster and able
    to handle heavier loads.

    O notation to speed up our code significantly.
