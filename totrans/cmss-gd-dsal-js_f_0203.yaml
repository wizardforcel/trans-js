- en: What you can take away from this book is a framework for making educated technology
    decisions. Creating great software involves evaluating the trade-offs of the available
    options, and you’re now armed with the ability to see the pros and cons of each
    option and make the best choice for the task at hand. And you also have the ability
    to think of new options that may not have been immediately obvious at first glance.

- en: I hope you also take away from this book the knowledge that topics like these—which
    seem so complex and esoteric—are just a combination of simpler, easier concepts
    that are within your grasp. Don’t be intimidated by resources that make a concept
    seem difficult simply because they don’t explain it well—a concept can always
    be broken down in a way it can be understood.

    within your reach. I invite you to continue your data structures and algorithms
    journey with me in Volume 2 of this book, which is expected to be published next.
    Keep your eye out for it.

    that are fascinating, powerful, and practical. I dare say that they’ll transform
    you into an even better software engineer than you are now. Most importantly,
    Volume 2 will continue to change the way you think.
