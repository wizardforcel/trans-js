    recursion to solve some rather complex problems.

- en: While recursion can certainly solve some problems, it can also create new ones
    if not used properly. In fact, recursion is often the culprit behind some of the
    slowest categories of Big O, such as O(2^N).

- en: The good news, though, is that many of these problems can be avoided. In this
    chapter, you’ll learn how to identify some of the most common speed traps found
    in recursive code and how to express such algorithms in terms of Big O. More important,
    you’ll learn the techniques to fix these problems.

    simple. Let’s take a look at how to use these easy but effective methods for turning
    our recursive nightmares into recursive bliss.'
