- en: In this chapter, we will explore error handling and debugging techniques in
    JavaScript. As developers, encountering errors and bugs is a common part of the
    development process. Being able to effectively handle errors and debug our code
    is crucial for building robust and reliable JavaScript applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Errors in JavaScript can occur due to various reasons, such as syntax errors,
    logical errors, or runtime exceptions. When an error occurs during the execution
    of our code, it can disrupt the normal flow and potentially cause the application
    to crash.

- en: JavaScript provides built-in error objects, such as `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`,
    and `ReferenceError`, to represent different types of errors. These error objects
    contain useful information, including an error message and a stack trace that
    helps identify the source of the error.

- en: 12.2 Handling Errors with try...catch
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `try...catch` statement is used to handle errors in JavaScript. It allows
    us to wrap a section of code in a `try` block and specify a `catch` block that
    will execute if an error occurs within the `try` block.

- en: In this example, the `try` block contains the code that might throw an error.
    If an error occurs, it will be caught by the `catch` block, and we can handle
    it accordingly. The `error` parameter in the `catch` block represents the error
    object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By using `try...catch`, we can gracefully handle errors and prevent them from
    crashing our application. We can also provide fallback behavior or display meaningful
    error messages to the user.

- en: 12.3 Throwing Custom Errors
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to built-in error objects, JavaScript allows us to create custom
    error objects using the `throw` statement. Custom errors can provide more specific
    information about the nature of the error and help with debugging.

- en: In this example, the `divide` function checks if the divisor (`b`) is zero.
    If it is, a custom `Error` object is thrown with a descriptive error message.
    The error is then caught and handled in the `catch` block.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By throwing custom errors, we can provide more meaningful information about
    exceptional situations and guide the debugging process.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing bugs in our code. JavaScript
    provides several tools and techniques to aid in the debugging process. Some commonly
    used techniques include:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Console.log: Placing `console.log` statements at strategic points in our
    code allows us to output values or messages to the console for inspection during
    runtime.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Breakpoints: Modern web browsers provide developer tools with a built-in
    debugger. By setting breakpoints at specific lines of code, we can pause the execution
    and inspect the state of variables, step through the code, and analyze the flow
    of execution.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Debugging Tools: Developer tools also offer a range of debugging features,
    such as inspecting the call stack, monitoring network requests, analyzing memory
    usage, and profiling performance.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Error Messages: Paying attention to error messages displayed in the console
    can provide valuable insights into the cause of the error. Error messages often
    include information about the type of error, the specific line of code where the
    error occurred, and additional details that can help in pinpointing the issue.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- Code Review: Asking a colleague or peer to review our code can provide fresh
    perspectives and identify potential issues that we might have overlooked.'

- en: '- Rubber Duck Debugging: Explaining our code and the problem we''re trying
    to solve to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck) can help us uncover logical
    errors or find alternative solutions. The act of verbalizing the problem often
    leads to new insights and discoveries.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By utilizing these debugging techniques, we can effectively identify and resolve
    bugs in our JavaScript code, resulting in more reliable and stable applications.

- en: 12.5 Handling Asynchronous Errors
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JavaScript often involves asynchronous operations, such as making network requests
    or accessing data from a database. Handling errors in asynchronous code requires
    a different approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One common approach is to use promises and the `catch` method to handle errors:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE2]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In this example, we define an `async` function `fetchData` that makes an asynchronous
    network request using the `fetch` API. We use `await` to wait for the response
    and the parsed data. If an error occurs during the request or parsing, it will
    be caught in the `catch` block.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By leveraging promises and the `catch` method, we can handle errors in asynchronous
    operations and ensure that our code gracefully handles any potential issues.

- en: Error handling and debugging are essential skills for JavaScript developers.
    By understanding how to handle errors using `try...catch`, throw custom errors,
    and employ effective debugging techniques, we can diagnose and fix bugs in our
    code more efficiently.

    errors, and various debugging techniques such as console logging, breakpoints,
    and utilizing developer tools. We also discussed handling errors in asynchronous
    code using promises and the `catch` method.
