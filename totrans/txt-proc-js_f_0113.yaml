- en: If you thought data structures and algorithms were all just theory, you’re missing
    out on what they can do for your Python code. Learn to use Big O notation to make
    your code run faster by orders of magnitude. Choose from data structures such
    as hash tables, trees, and graphs to increase your code’s efficiency exponentially.
    With simple language and clear diagrams, this book makes this complex topic accessible,
    no matter your background. Every chapter features practice exercises to give you
    the hands-on information you need to master data structures and algorithms for
    your day-to-day work.

- en: Whatever you want to do with text, Ruby is up to the job. No matter what the
    source – web pages, databases, the contents of files – learn how to acquire the
    text and get it into your program. Explore techniques to process that text and
    then output the transformed or extracted text. Cut even the most complex text-based
    tasks down to size and learn how to master regular expressions, scrape information
    from Web pages, develop reusable utilities to process text in pipelines, and more.

- en: 'Businesses own more data than ever before, but it’s of no value if you don’t
    know how to use it. Data governance manages the people, processes, and strategy
    needed for deploying data projects to production. But doing it well is far from
    easy: Less than one fourth of business leaders say their organizations are data
    driven. In Designing Data Governance from the Ground Up, you’ll build a cross-functional
    strategy to create roadmaps and stewardship for data-focused projects, embed data
    governance into your engineering practice, and put processes in place to monitor
    data after deployment.'

- en: Build applications quicker and with less effort using functional programming
    and Kotlin. Learn by building a complete application, from gathering requirements
    to delivering a microservice architecture following functional programming principles.
    Learn how to implement CQRS and EventSourcing in a functional way to map the domain
    into code better and to keep the cost of change low for the whole application
    life cycle. If you’re curious about functional programming or you are struggling
    with how to put it into practice, this guide will help you increase your productivity
    composing small functions together instead of creating fat objects.
