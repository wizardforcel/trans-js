- en: The `Quicksort` and `Quickselect` algorithms are recursive algorithms that present
    beautiful and efficient solutions to thorny problems. They’re great examples of
    how a non-obvious but well-thought-out algorithm can boost performance.

- en: Now that we’ve seen some more advanced algorithms, we’re now going to head in
    a new direction and explore a trove of additional data structures. Some of these
    data structures have operations that involve recursion, so we’ll be fully prepared
    to tackle those now. Besides their being really interesting, we’ll see that each
    data structure has a special power that can bring significant advantages to a
    variety of applications.
