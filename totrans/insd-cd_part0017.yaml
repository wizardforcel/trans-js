- en: Balancing readability and performance is an ongoing process. Remember that optimizing
    for readability should be the default approach, and optimizations should be made
    judiciously based on performance profiling and real-world needs. Striking the
    right balance will result in code that is not only performant but also understandable
    and maintainable by your development team.
