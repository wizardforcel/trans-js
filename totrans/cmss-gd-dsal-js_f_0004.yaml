    given to me. You took care of everything while I hunkered down like a recluse
    and wrote. To my adorable kids, `Tuvi`, `Leah`, `Shaya`, `Rami`, and `Yechiel`—thank
    you for your patience as I wrote my book on “algorizms.” And yes—it’s finally
    done.

    sparking my interest in computer programming and helping me pursue it. Little
    did you know that getting me a computer tutor for my ninth birthday would set
    the foundation for my career—and now this book.

    it was good. However, through the expertise, suggestions, and demands of all the
    wonderful people who work there, the book has become something much, much better
    than I could have written on my own.
