    the `list`. Assume you don’t know how many elements are in the `list`.

- en: Here’s a tricky one. Add a method to the `classic LinkedList` class that reverses
    the `list`; that is, if the original `list` is `A -> B -> C`, all of the `list`’s
    links should change so that `C -> B -> A`.

    to a `node` from somewhere in the middle of a `classic linked list` but not to
    the `linked list` itself; that is, you have a variable that points to an instance
    of `Node`, but you don’t have access to the `LinkedList` instance. In this situation,
    if you follow this `node`’s link, you can find all the values from this middle
    `node` until the end, but you have no way to find the nodes that precede this
    `node` in the `list`.

    remaining list should remain complete, with only this node removed.
