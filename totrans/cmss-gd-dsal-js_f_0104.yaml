- en: In the previous chapter, you learned what recursion is and how it works. I found
    on my own learning journey that even once I understood how recursion works, I
    still struggled to write my own recursive functions.

- en: Through deliberate practice and taking note of various recursive patterns, I
    discovered some techniques that helped me to learn to “write in recursive” more
    easily, and I’d like to share them with you. Along the way, you’ll discover additional
    areas where recursion shines.

- en: Note that we won’t be discussing the efficiency of recursion in this chapter.
    Recursion can actually have a terribly negative impact on the time complexity
    of an algorithm, but this is the subject of the next chapter. For now, we’re just
    going to focus on developing the recursive mindset.
