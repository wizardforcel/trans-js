    the value doesn’t already exist within the set. This search will take 100 steps.
    Then we need to shift all 100 elements to the right to make room for the new value.
    Finally, we drop the new value at the beginning of the set. This is a total of
    201 steps.

    inserting, which takes 100 steps. We then conclude with the final step of inserting

    `"apple"` in an array will take `N` steps. When searching for just one instance,
    we can cut our search short as soon as we find it. But if we need to find all
    instances, we have no choice but to inspect each element of the entire array.
