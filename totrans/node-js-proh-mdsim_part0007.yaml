- en: In this chapter, we will dive deeper into the world of Node.js modules and explore
    the powerful features of the Node Package Manager (NPM). Understanding modules
    and leveraging the vast ecosystem of NPM packages will enhance your ability to
    build robust and efficient Node.js applications.

- en: Node.js modules allow you to organize and encapsulate your code into reusable
    units. Each module can contain functions, variables, or objects that can be accessed
    by other parts of your application. By breaking down your code into modules, you
    can achieve better code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

- en: NPM is a powerful package manager that comes bundled with Node.js. It provides
    a vast ecosystem of open-source packages that you can easily integrate into your
    Node.js projects. NPM simplifies package installation, dependency management,
    and version control, making it a fundamental tool for Node.js developers.

- en: We have already seen how to initialize a project with NPM in Chapter 2\. By
    running `npm init` in your project directory, you create a "package.json" file
    that keeps track of your project's metadata and dependencies.

    it requires, into a "node_modules" directory within your project.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The "package.json" file maintains a list of dependencies for your project. When
    you install packages using `npm install`, NPM automatically adds them to the "dependencies"
    section of your "package.json" file. This allows you to easily manage and share
    your project's dependencies with others.
