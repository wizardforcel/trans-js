    a restaurant, and you’re implementing a menu of foods with their respective prices.
    You could, technically, use an `array`:'

    The first element is a string representing the food on the menu, and the second
    element represents the price of that food.

    if this `array` were unordered, searching for the price of a given food would
    take `O(N)` steps since the computer would have to perform a linear search. If
    it’s an ordered `array`, the computer could do a binary search, which would take
    `O(log N)`.

    By the end of this chapter, you’ll learn how to use a special data structure called
    a `hash table`, which can be used to look up data in just `O(1)` time. By knowing
    how `hash tables` work under the hood and the right places to use them, you can
    leverage their tremendous lookup speeds in many situations.
