    of its design philosophy. Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, summarized
    this philosophy in the “Zen of Python” (PEP 20), a collection of aphorisms that
    capture the essence of Python’s design principles. Let’s explore some of these
    principles and how they influence Python’s development:'

    The use of indentation instead of braces for code blocks enforces a consistent
    and visually appealing structure.'

    acknowledges that some problems are inherently complex. In such cases, Python
    aims to provide clear and elegant solutions.'

    blocks. This helps maintain code clarity and prevents “deep” nesting that can
    make code hard to follow.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    less dense, enhancing readability. This aligns with the idea that code is read
    more often than it is written.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in coding conventions. Even though there might be exceptions, adhering to established
    rules is usually preferred.'

    When something goes wrong, Python raises exceptions to make issues explicit rather
    than letting them go unnoticed.'
