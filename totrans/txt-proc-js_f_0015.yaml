    (hex) color codes. You want to provide a field that lets users enter a color name
    to be converted to its hex equivalence automatically.

- en: Hexadecimal notation is commonly used to specify colors in programs and web
    development because it provides a compact and efficient way to represent a wide
    range of colors.

- en: 'In hex notation, colors are made of a combination of red, green, and blue (RGB)
    values, each represented by a two-digit hex number (00 to FF), with the first
    two digits representing the intensity of red, the next two digits representing
    the intensity of green, and the last two digits representing the intensity of
    blue. For example, the color white is represented by the hex code #FFFFFF, which
    has maximum values for all three colors.'

- en: In this solution, we define a function that takes in a single parameter called
    color, which should be a string representing a color. Inside the function, we
    create a new HTML canvas element by using the document.createElement() method.
    This method creates an HTML element based on the tag name provided as the argument.
    In this case, we use the tag name “canvas” to create a canvas element.

- en: Next, we create a context object for the canvas using the getContext() method.
    We specify that the context object should be for a two-dimensional canvas by passing
    “2d” as an argument. We then set the fillStyle property of the context object
    to the parameter that was passed to the function. This sets the color that will
    be used to fill any shapes drawn on the canvas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Now we can read the fillStyle property of the context object to get the hex
    value of the color. When we call the function with the argument Khaki, it will
    create a canvas element, set the fillStyle to Khaki, and return the hex value
    of the color #F0E68C. Note that this function does not actually draw anything
    on the canvas—it only creates the canvas element and sets the fillStyle.'

- en: Before returning the hex value from the function, we used the toUpperCase()
    method to convert the hex letters to uppercase. In JavaScript and CSS, hex colors
    can be written using either uppercase or lowercase letters. Both uppercase and
    lowercase hex letters represent the same values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, it’s common practice to use uppercase letters for hex colors because it
    can make the code easier to read and differentiate from other text in the code.
    Ultimately, the choice between the two styles is a matter of personal preference
    or style guide.

    can be used across different software platforms and devices. A list of web colors
    and their hex equivalent is available on Wikipedia.^([[7]](f_0032.xhtml#FOOTNOTE-7))
