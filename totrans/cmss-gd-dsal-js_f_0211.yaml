- en: In Big O notation, 2N² + 2N + 1 gets reduced to O(N²). After getting rid of
    all the constants, we’re left with N² + N, but we also drop the N since it’s a
    lower order than N².

- en: The important thing to note here is that the function ends as soon as we find
    a pair that sums to 10\. The best-case scenario, then, is when the first two numbers
    add up to 10, since we can end the function before the loops even get underway.
    An average-case scenario may be when the two numbers are somewhere in the middle
    of the array. The worst-case scenarios are when there aren’t any two numbers that
    add up to 10, in which case we must exhaust both loops completely. This worst-case
    scenario is O(N²), where N is the size of the array.

- en: This algorithm has an efficiency of O(N), as the size of the array is N, and
    the loop iterates through all N elements.

    the array. We can make the code more efficient if we return true as soon as we
    find an “X”:'
