    to broadly determine the efficiency of an algorithm, and we can also compare two
    algorithms that fall within one classification of `Big O`.

- en: However, another important factor must be taken into account when comparing
    the efficiencies of two algorithms. Until now, we’ve focused on how fast an algorithm
    is in a worst-case scenario. Now, worst-case scenarios, by definition, don’t happen
    all the time. On average, most scenarios that occur are…well…average-case scenarios.
    In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to take all scenarios into account.
