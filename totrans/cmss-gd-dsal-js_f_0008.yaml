- en: The code in this book has been updated to follow ECMAScript 6+ standards. Where
    possible, I also strived to follow a modern JavaScript style inspired by the Airbnb
    JavaScript Style Guide.^([[1]](f_0012.xhtml#FOOTNOTE-1)) That being said, I deviated
    from certain rules in cases where I thought that doing so would help keep the
    code easier to understand.

- en: One such example is that JavaScript is blessed (or cursed, depending on your
    viewpoint) with many different types of loop syntax. Even though the modern forEach
    loop could be used in many of the code snippets, there are plenty of cases where
    it would not be the optimal choice. And I felt that having too many different
    types of loops across all the code snippets would be a little jarring. And so,
    to use a consistent syntax throughout the book, I stick to using just two different
    types of for loops.

- en: In addition, I want to emphasize that the concepts in this book apply to virtually
    all coding languages, and I expect that some people not as familiar with JavaScript
    will be reading this book. Because of this, sometimes I avoid certain JavaScript
    idioms when I thought they would confuse people coming from other languages. It’s
    a tricky balance to keep the code “JavaScripty” while also being welcoming to
    non-JavaScript coders, but I hope that I’ve maintained an equilibrium that satisfies
    most readers.

- en: Virtually all the code in this book can be downloaded online from the book’s
    web page.^([[2]](f_0012.xhtml#FOOTNOTE-2)) This code repository contains automated
    tests too! I encourage you to check that out since the tests don’t appear in the
    actual book. Note that I’ve used a modular system for sharing files and used Node.js
    to run all my code.

- en: You’ll find some longer code snippets under the headings that read “Code Implementation.”
    I certainly encourage you to study these code samples, but you don’t necessarily
    have to understand every last line to proceed to the next section of the book.
    If these long pieces of code are bogging you down, just skim (or skip) them for
    now.

- en: Finally, it’s important to note that the code in this book is not “production
    ready.” My greatest focus has been to clarify the concept at hand, and while I
    did also try to make the code generally complete, I have not accounted for every
    edge case. There’s certainly room for you to optimize the code further—so feel
    free to go crazy with that.
