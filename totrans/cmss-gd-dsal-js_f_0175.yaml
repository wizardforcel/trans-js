    There are many other types of trees as well, such as AVL trees, red black trees
    (covered in Volume 2 of this book), 2-3-4 trees, and plenty of others. Each tree
    has unique traits and behaviors that can be leveraged for specific situations.
    I encourage you to learn more about these various trees, but for now you have
    a taste for how different trees can solve different problems.'

    about trees will help you understand graphs. Graphs are helpful in so many different
    situations, and that’s why they’re so popular. So let’s dive in.
