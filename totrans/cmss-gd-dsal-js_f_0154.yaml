- en: You learned about [`Queues`](f_0092.xhtml#sect.queues), and discovered that
    the queue is a list in which items are processed first in, first out (FIFO). Essentially,
    this means that data is inserted only at the end of the queue, and data is accessed
    and removed only from the front of the queue. In accessing the queue’s data, we
    give precedence to the order in which the data was inserted.

- en: A priority queue is a list whose deletions and access are just like a classic
    queue but whose insertions are like an ordered array. So we only delete and access
    data from the front of the priority queue, but when we insert data, we always
    make sure the data remains sorted in a specific order.

- en: One classic example of where a priority queue is helpful is an application that
    manages the triage system for a hospital emergency room. In the ER, we don’t treat
    people strictly in the order in which they arrived. Instead, we treat people in
    the order of the severity of their symptoms. If someone suddenly arrives with
    a life-threatening injury, that patient will be placed at the front of the queue,
    even if the person with the flu had arrived hours earlier.

    the front of the priority queue since that person’s need is the most urgent. In
    this case, the next patient we’d treat is `Patient C`.

- en: 'The priority queue is an example of an abstract data type—one that can be implemented
    using other, more fundamental, data structures. One straightforward way we can
    implement a priority queue is by using an ordered array; that is, we use an array
    and apply the following constraints:'

    that deleting from the front of an array is O(N) since we have to shift all the
    data over to fill the gap created at index `0`\. However, we’ve cleverly tweaked
    our implementation so that we consider the end of the array to be the front of
    the priority queue. This way, we’re always deleting from the end of the array,
    which is O(1).

    about insertions?

- en: You learned that inserting into an ordered array is `O(N)` since we have to
    inspect up to all `N` elements of the array to determine where our new data should
    go. (And even if we find the correct spot early, we need to then shift all the
    remaining data over to the right.)

- en: Our array-based priority queue, then, has deletions that are `O(1)` and insertions
    that are `O(N)`. If we expect there to be many items in our priority queue, the
    `O(N)` insertions may cause some real unwanted drag in our application.

    serves as a more efficient foundation for the priority queue. This data structure
    is the `heap`.
