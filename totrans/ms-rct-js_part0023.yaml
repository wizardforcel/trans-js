- en: In Chapter 1, we got a glimpse of JavaScript's syntax and how to write simple
    programs. Now, let's take a deeper dive into the world of data types and variables
    in JavaScript. Understanding data types is essential as it forms the foundation
    for how information is stored, manipulated, and processed within a program. Additionally,
    variables enable us to assign values to memory locations and use those values
    throughout our code. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid grasp of
    JavaScript's data types and how to work with variables effectively.

    their data type during the execution of the program. There are two main categories

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Reference data types are passed by reference, meaning that when you assign a
    reference value (such as an object or an array) to a variable or pass it as an
    argument to a function, you are actually assigning a pointer to the memory location
    where the value is stored. As a result, changes made to the variable or the argument
    can affect the original value since they both point to the same memory location.

- en: In Example 8, the first `console.log` statement outputs `undefined` because
    the variable `name` is hoisted to the top of the scope, but its assignment (`name
    = 'John Doe'`) is not hoisted. Therefore, the variable exists but has no value
