    There you can find more information about my `books` as well as `video tutorials`
    made by my colleagues and me in which we use the “common-sense” approach to explaining
    all sorts of `technologies` and `concepts`. In particular, you might enjoy my
    “Jay Vs. `Leetcode`”^([[5]](f_0012.xhtml#FOOTNOTE-5)) video series where I solve
    `programming puzzles` using many of the techniques discussed in this `book`.
