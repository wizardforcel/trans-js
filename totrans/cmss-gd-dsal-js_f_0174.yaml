- en: If we think about it, a good autocomplete feature isn’t necessarily going to
    display every possible word the user might be intending to type. Showing, say,
    sixteen options would be overwhelming to the user, so we’d rather show just the
    most popular words from the available list。

- en: For example, if the user starts typing`“bal”`, the user might be intending to
    type`“ball”`，`“bald”`，or`“balance”`。Now, it’s also possible that the user is typing
    the obscure word`“balter”` (which means to dance clumsily, if you wanted to know)。However,
    odds are that`“balter”`is not the intended word, since it’s not a common word。

- en: To display the most popular word options, we somehow need to store the word
    popularity data in our trie as well. And we’re in luck since we only need to make
    a slight modification to our trie to accomplish this。

- en: In our current trie implementation, every time we’ve set an`"*"`key, we’ve made
    its value null. This is because we’ve only ever paid attention to the`"*"`key;
    the value carried no significance。

- en: However, we can take advantage of these values to store additional data about
    the words themselves, such as how popular they are. To keep things simple, let’s
    work with a simple range of`1`to`10`，with`1`being the rarest kind of word, and`10`being
    an extremely popular word。

- en: Let’s say`“ball”`is a very popular word and has a popularity score of`10`。The
    word`“balance”`may be slightly less popular and have a score of`9`。The word`“bald”`is
    used even less often and has a score of`7`。And since`“balter”`is a hardly known
    word, we’ll give it a score of`1`。We can store these scores in the trie this way：

- en: By using a number as the value of each`"*"`key, we can effectively store each
    word’s popularity score. When we now collect all the words of the trie, we can
    collect their scores along with them and then sort the words in order of their
    popularity. We can then choose to only display the most popular word options。
