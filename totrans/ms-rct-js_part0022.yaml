- en: JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, and versatile
    programming language used for building interactive web applications. Created by
    Brendan Eich in 1995, it quickly became one of the most popular programming languages
    on the web. Initially designed to add interactivity to static web pages, it has
    evolved over the years into a full-fledged programming language capable of handling
    complex tasks.

    the user experience by creating interactive and dynamic elements on websites.
    From simple form validations to sophisticated web applications, JavaScript empowers
    developers to bring their ideas to life and engage users in meaningful ways.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Variables are fundamental in any programming language, as they allow us to store
    and manipulate data. In JavaScript, variables can hold different types of data,
    such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. Before using a
    variable, it must be declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword.

    variables. However, it has some limitations, such as hoisting and scope-related
    issues.

    which addresses the scope-related problems of `var`.

    a constant `PI`. The value of a variable declared with `let` can be changed, while
    the value of a constant declared with `const` remains fixed throughout the program
    execution.
