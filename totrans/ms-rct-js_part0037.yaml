- en: Software architecture patterns are fundamental concepts that provide structural
    and organizational guidance for designing and building software systems. These
    patterns help developers create scalable, maintainable, and reliable applications
    by providing proven solutions to common architectural challenges. In this chapter,
    we will explore some of the most popular software architecture patterns, including
    the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, Microservices architecture, and Serverless
    architecture, along with examples to illustrate their implementation and benefits.

    patterns for designing web applications. It separates an application into three
    interconnected components:'

- en: a. Model
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible
    for managing the data and processing the application's core functionality.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The View is responsible for displaying the user interface and presenting data
    to users. It receives input from users and sends it to the Controller for further
    processing.

- en: c. Controller
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives
    user input from the View, processes it using the Model, and updates the View accordingly.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Microservices architecture is an architectural style that structures an application
    as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other
    through APIs. Each service is focused on a specific business capability and can
    be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

    developed, deployed, and maintained separately from other services.'

    system since other services can continue to function independently.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Serverless architecture is an execution model where cloud providers handle server
    management and provisioning, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code.
    In a serverless environment, functions are executed in response to events, such
    as HTTP requests, database changes, or file uploads.

    automatically manages the infrastructure.'

    function instances based on demand.'

    making it cost-efficient.'

    invocations.'
