    in programming. Concurrency and parallelism are essential concepts that enable
    a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making efficient use of modern
    multi-core processors. We’ll explore the basics of concurrency, multithreading,

- en: Concurrency refers to the ability of a program to manage multiple tasks seemingly
    simultaneously. It doesn’t necessarily mean that tasks run in parallel, but it
    gives the illusion of overlapping execution. Concurrency is particularly useful
    in scenarios where tasks involve waiting for external events or resources.
  prefs: []

    Concurrency allows the server to handle these requests without waiting for one
    to complete before starting the next.

    can be executed concurrently on separate processors or cores. This can significantly
