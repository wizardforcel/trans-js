    two given strings are anagrams of one another. We encountered an anagram function
    before in `[*Anagram Generation*](f_0109.xhtml#sect.anagram-generation)`, but
    there we dealt with a function that produced every anagram of a string. Here,
    we’re just going to compare two strings side by side. We’ll return `true` if they’re
    anagrams of each other and `false` if they’re not.
  id: totrans-5

  stylish: true
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, we could use the anagram-generating function to solve this problem; that
    is, we can produce all the anagrams of the first string and see if the second
    string matches any of those anagrams. However, since for `N` characters in the
    string there will always be `N!` anagrams, our algorithm will take at least `O(N!)`
    time. This is disastrously slow.

    And since the input strings may be of different sizes, touching each character
    just once would be `O(N + M)`. As I couldn’t imagine a faster speed for the task
    at hand, this is what we’ll aim for.
  id: totrans-8
  prefs: []
  stylish: true
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In theory, we could put some code at the beginning of the function that immediately
    returns `false` if the two strings have different sizes, since it’s impossible
    for strings of different sizes to be anagrams. In that case, the speed we’d aim
    for is `2N` since the algorithm will only be working with strings that are the
    same size. This reduces to `O(N)`.
  id: totrans-9

- en: A second possible approach to our problem is to run nested loops to compare
    the two strings. Specifically, as an outer loop iterates over each character from
    the first string, we compare that character to every character of the second string.
    Each time we find a match, we delete a character from the second string. The idea
    here is that if every character from the first string is also present in the second
    string, we’d end up deleting every character from the second string by the time
    we complete our outer loop.
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  stylish: true
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, if by the time we finish looping, characters still remain from the second
    string, it means the strings aren’t anagrams. Also, if we’re still iterating over
    the first word but we’ve already deleted the entire second string, it also means
    the strings aren’t anagrams. But if we make it to the end of the loop and the
    second string has been completely deleted, we can conclude that the two strings
    are indeed anagrams.

    through it can be error prone; if you don’t do it right, it’s like sawing off
    the tree branch you’re sitting on. But even though we’ve handled that correctly,
    our algorithm runs at O(`N` * `M`). This is way faster than O(`N!`) but much slower
    than the O(`N` + `M`) we’re shooting for.

    the O(N log N) that sorting would have taken. We do use up O(N) space with the
    extra `hashTable` and `newArray`, although we could choose to overwrite the original
    array to save additional memory. That being said, the space taken up by the `hashTable`
    would still be O(N) in the worst case, where each string in the array is different.
