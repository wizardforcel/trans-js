- en: As React applications grow in complexity, so does the need for efficient state
    management. Redux is a powerful library that provides a centralized and predictable
    state management solution for React and other JavaScript applications. In this
    chapter, we will delve into Redux and explore how it can be used to handle advanced
    state management scenarios.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The central piece of Redux is the **store**, which acts as a single source of
    truth for the application's state. The store holds the current state and provides
    methods for reading and updating it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. **Actions**
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Actions** are plain JavaScript objects that describe changes to the state.
    They must have a `type` property that specifies the type of action being performed.
    Actions are typically created by functions known as action creators.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. **Reducers**
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Reducers** are pure functions that define how the state should change in
    response to an action. They take the current state and an action as input and
    return a new state. Reducers should be kept simple and predictable.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. **Dispatch**
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **dispatch** function is used to send actions to the Redux store. When an
    action is dispatched, it triggers a state update through the reducers.

- en: 5\. **Selectors**
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Selectors** are functions that allow you to extract specific pieces of data
    from the Redux store. They are useful for retrieving data from the store in a
    structured way.'

    and process actions before they reach the reducers. Common use cases for middleware
    include logging, asynchronous operations, and routing.'

  prefs:

    root of the React component tree. It ensures that the Redux store is available
    to all components in the tree.
