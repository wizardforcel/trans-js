    as the foundation upon which code is written, and understanding it is essential
    for any developer. In this section, we will explore the significance of syntax
    in programming languages and how it influences the way code is written and interpreted.

    code execution. In contrast, C++ emphasizes manual memory management as a core
    semantic feature.

    correct and efficient code. It allows developers to express their intentions accurately
    and ensures that the code behaves as desired. Additionally, knowing the semantics
    of a language enables developers to troubleshoot and debug code effectively, as
    they can identify and rectify semantic errors.
